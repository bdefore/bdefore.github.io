Flappr is a Flash 8 interface for Flickr. Its goal is to provide a more explorative way of browsing the best repository of publicly shared photographs on the Internet.

**Features:**



	
  * Built upon [Flashr](http://osflash.org/flashr), a data wrapper for Flickr and Flash created by [Kelvinluck](http://kelvinluck.com)

	
  * Sort by "interestingness" - Flickr's recent ranking algorithm that puts more popular photos to the top of your search

	
  * User tabs allow you to jump from the photos you are viewing to more photos by the user that took them

	
  * Related tags along the top of the screen provide jumping points to similar tag searches

	
  * You can now save a photo to your Flickr favorites list (authentication requried)

	
  * You can quickly link to the photo's page on Flickr

	
  * ... or to a permalink that brings you back to where you were looking in Flappr
