DONALD BARTHELME
Besides being a personal favorite, others seem to enjoy Donald Barthelme's punchy and cerebral short stories. I have no time to pin a genre to him. He's odd, and his stories are fabulous. I've named this theme in honor of him and his story "Margins" (the first story in the book _60 Stories_). Learn more about Donald Barthelme and even read some of his stories:
