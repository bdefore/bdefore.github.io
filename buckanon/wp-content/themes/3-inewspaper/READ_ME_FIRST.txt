Everything works out of the box except for AdSense. If you want to activate AdSense, read on...

AdSense: 

In order to activate AdSense for the iNewspaper Theme, do the following:

1) Open ads.php located inside of each Fruit Theme folder.

2) Look for: <?php $googleAdsenseId = ""; (should be the first line)

3) In between the "", fill in your AdSense Account Number. 

4) Save and Upload the file. 

5) If you did everything correctly, Adsense will display in the header on all of your web pages.

6) To disable AdSense, simply delete the number inside of the "" in the same ads.php file. Leave everything else as is.

7) Save and Upload the file.
