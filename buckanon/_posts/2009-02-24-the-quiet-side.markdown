Here are two recordings that are a little less hectic than a rodeo or a soccer match, more ideal to put on while you're doing something else.The first is rain recorded from inside my tent while I slept. I can't remember exactly when this was recorded. If I had to take a guess I would say it happened on the morning we arrived in Villa Cerro Castillo. Previous to recording this I fought a bout of insomnia (not like me). I left the tent early in the morning to witness an incredible sunrise, which I shared with a stray dog I would take to calling Lombard for reasons that I'm not fully conscious of. Something about her being blonde and Italian. Lombard would follow me back to the tent where I offered her some butter before sleeping through the rain inside. When I woke up a couple hours later, she was nearby, having sat through the rain under a shelter of trees nearby.[audio:fieldrecording/rainontent.mp3]The second is the sound of a bell ringing as horses graze, mixed with the lapping of waves to a shore steeply below. There was heavy wind all around me but fortunately for the sake of the recording I was sheltered by a massive boulder. I was also visited by a fox at one moment (shame you can't hear him). Around 2:10 you can hear either a plane taking off or an avalanche across the channel - strangely I couldn't tell you which it is.[audio:fieldrecording/horsebell3_lessbass.mp3]
