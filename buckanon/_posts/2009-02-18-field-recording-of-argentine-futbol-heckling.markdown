In contrast to the previous recordings, these were made directly from the R-09's internal microphones, as the unit sat in the top mesh of my tent (which at times you can hear flapping in the wind). A family played futbol nearby. I would later join them, and they would sobrenombre me 'Beckham' but certainly not for my playing ability.[audio:fieldrecording/soccermatchinparque_sb.mp3]
