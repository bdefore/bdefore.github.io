This is the first in what I hope will be a set of field recordings from my trip to the Patagonia. This was recorded during a rodeo that I serendipitously stumbled into in FutaleufÃº, which was en route from Puyuhuapi through the pass to Argentina. This was recorded with binaural mics on my Edirol R-09.[audio:fieldrecording/rodeo1.mp3]And, more for comedic value than anything, a recording of my trip to the very sloshy and crowded bathroom at the same event:[audio:fieldrecording/bathroomchatterrodeo.mp3]
