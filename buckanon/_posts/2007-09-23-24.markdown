Having reached a plateau of comfort with my ability to reproduce Thai iced teas, I've decided to embark upon a survey of San Francisco bubble teas. I've made a pleasant discovery of a rather modest $2.16 taro milk tea, including tapioca. As a comparison, my previous sampling of a rather unremarkable version on the tourist stretch of Grant Avenue was half again as much.I'm not sure how I'd missed this place, located, as they are, across from a favorite market of mine on Powell and Jackson (right where the cable car tracks bend uphill on their way to Pac Heights). It's not an area of heavy foot traffic, which belies the fact that the shop is usually elbow-to-elbow in their tiny little shop. The place is named [Quickly](http://www.quicklyusa.com/), a name which is only now failing to provide a smirk. They're actually a huge operation, not just over the Bay Area but globally, which leads me to believe that I'm only scratching the surface of SF bubble tea operations. No doubt there's all kinds of flak on the net about this being 'corporate bubble tea', which, since I'm in a strange mood today, leads me to a feeling of shameless candor, as I reckon I'll probably move on to more worthy venues in the next few months. I'll keep you updated.For further trivia, Quickly's been in the news of late for their connection with the [Ed Jew extortion/mail-fraud scandal](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/19/EDJEW.TMP).Along those lines, I've failed to mention this the last few months, but one perk of living here is that I'm very content to be reunited with easy access to [White Rabbit candies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit_Creamy_Candy) - they're all over the place here, though it does take a bit of hunting to find ones that are fresh and soft. My first encounter was on a road trip from college years ago, and for some reason I've never had much luck finding them outside of SF Chinatown.
