Date: 7 September, 2005

ABOUT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FlickrSSP allows you to use Flickr (http://www.flickr.com) and SlideshowPro 
(http://www.slideshowpro.net) to display all of your Flickr photosets on 
your own website instead of just your recent photos via the RSS feed.


SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Unzip the files and upload them to your web server
2. Edit flickrssp.php by adding your NSID and Flickr API Key values
3. Edit your SlideShowPro .fla file and change the XMLFilePath to point to
the flickrssp.php file, if it isn't already. Upload the new .swf to the server.
4. Make the images.xml file writable on the server (i.e., chmod 777 images.xml)
