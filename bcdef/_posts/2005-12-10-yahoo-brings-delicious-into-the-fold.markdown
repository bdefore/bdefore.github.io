If you're an acolyte of the community-based web experience, you've probably used or at least heard of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), the site that popularized tag-based social bookmarking. You're probably also aware that while its popularity rages among web afficianados, and it would seem to benefit all humanity, it never really caught on among the masses. I suppose it was too easy to be snickered away from the water cooler for mentioning  "yeah, delicious. no, it's cool.. just put a dot between the 'l' and the 'i' and..." 

Well Yahoo's [officially picked up the del.icio.us experiment](http://www.kesq.com/Global/story.asp?S=4226128&nav=9qrx), ostensibly with plans to let the originators continue where they were going. Sounds well enough. Maybe they'll be integrated into the [My Web 2.0 project](http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/). I hope that however it turns out, they can adapt the spirit of del.icio.us into something reborn into an easier-to-approach and easier-to-explore system.

Quote of note :


> Yahoo officials didn't disclose how much it paid for Delicious because it wasn't expensive enough to have a significant impact on its finances.



Isn't that the way? Some of the web's best ideas are also the humblest and least money-making of ideas. Does being wrapped under the umbrella of the .com big guns stunt or aid places like del.icio.us? The past few months seem to have been beneficial for Flickr at least.
