Flappr, my pet project to design a more explorative interface for Flickr, has just bumped to its most significant update. [Check it out](http://bcdef.org/flappr/).

**A few of the new features:**



	
  * _User Profile Panel:_ Clicking on a buddy icon now opens up the new User Profile section, which gives you quick access to more information on the photographer, their favorites, and now a legitimate and easier-to-use display of their photosets.

	
  * _Quickly view a grid of previous photos: _this was a feature/bug that had for a long time been accessible by hovering to the right side of the screen. It's now properly encapsulated into a button down by the userstrips.

	
  * _Search history:_ Go back to any search you made, viewing a list of the most recent. It will even remember searches from your previous visits. Try it out by clicking either the down arrow in the thumbnail container or by using the new button nearby the userstrips.

	
  * _Running newest builds of Flashr and Fuse_ = snappier tweens and faster, cacheable data requests.

	
  * Adding to favorites now displays confirmation

	
  * A new spinning square when the photo enlargement is loading in! (ok, so why save the best for last, anyway?)


**Bug fixes:**



	
  * FlapprLinks have received a long-overdue renovation

	
  * Pagination issues are resolved (this was previously a headache for favorites/photosets)

	
  * Repositioning after a browser resize now more reliable

	
  * Keyboard shortcuts no longer interfere with comment form

	
  * Hover boxes no longer appear over photos without titles

	
  * Text overflows, while not entirely gone, are greatly minimized
