It's been a busy six months! Now that things have tempered, I figured it's time to defibrolate -bcdef- and give everyone an update.

Yes, it's official, I am working with the documentation team at Adobe. I wear many hats day-to-day, but the short of it: I'll be contributing to samples development, expanding documentation, and ironing out the kinks in Adobe's upcoming technologies surrounding the Flash Player.

I still have a lot of cleaning house to do before you can expect regular updates, but given a spare moment, I hope to update the frame of -bcdef- to reflect the news. Given other spare moments, I hope to actually cover relevant news once in a while.
Among the significant news of the last month or so:



	
  * [The open-sourcing of the Flash player scripting engine.](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/)

	
  * A [beta release](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/) of a Linux/i386 Flash player 9. (Some [history](http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/))


Now, to hit the 'Publish' button and hope the server doesn't imitate the tin-man after too long without an oiling.
