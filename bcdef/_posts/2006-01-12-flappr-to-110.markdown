Wrapping up development on [Flappr](http://bcdef.org/?page_id=2)... 

_Changes in 1.1.0:_




  * Many graphical adjustments. Search area is now a bar with options underneath, thumb container moves directly under the options.


  * On lower resolutions, the user strips would obstruct images of vertical aspect. This has been fixed.


  * Selecting a tag in the header of the thumb container box removes that tag and reperforms the search without it.


  * Hover box comes up with photo title.


  * Clicking a userstrip's icon displays the user's most-recent photos.


  * You can now specify which page of results you want. The page report has now moved down by the prev / next buttons.


  * Image descriptions now match the aspect of the photo - previously vertically aligned photos would have descriptions that spilled over the right side


  * HTML is now supported within image descriptions


  * Employs newest Flashr build's support of cached data requests (should help significantly if you hit the 'prev' button or otherwise search for something you've already searched for)



If there's any more requests, send them along before I finally bid this project adieu.
