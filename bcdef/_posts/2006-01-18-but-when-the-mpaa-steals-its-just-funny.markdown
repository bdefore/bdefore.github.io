So, let's say you were the kind of person who wanted to report piracy to Motion Picture Association of America, and you went to the submission form on their site, would you be peturbed that the source of the page blatantly confesses that the MPAA is using open-source software without fulfilling the author's plainspoken license of use?

Join the gaggle, have a [gander](http://designetc.net/mpaa.jpg) and be ready to giggle. 

For good measure, this post was reproduced without the expressed written consent of [Cory Doctorow](http://boingboing.net), who himself stole his cleverness from [Digg](http://www.digg.com), a greater body of the Internet's collective consciousness.

Have a nice day!
