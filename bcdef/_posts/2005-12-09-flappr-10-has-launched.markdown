It's been a long time coming, through spurts and starts... but looking at it this afternoon, I just couldn't see any major reason why not to offiicially declare my pet project version 1.0. A lot of late night endeavors attempting to merge Flash amicably with Flickr have finally brought about the point where I'm ready to let someone else kick the tires for a while. So have at it while it's piping hot! You can read about it on the [project page](/?page_id=2) or, for the interminably impatient, try it [here](/flappr/).

And while I was at it I figured it was long overdue for me to kick start the blog all over again. So here you have this as well. Whee. I'll tidy it up a bit later.
