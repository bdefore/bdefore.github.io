It's a shame I'm only coming across this now, but better late than never. This recording, from FITC '08 Toronto, is a really inspiring take on how [Robert Hodgin](http://www.flight404.com/blog/) has used Processing to create some really amazing visual displays. He takes much of his inspirations from Perlin Noise, algorithmic repetition, and user-interactivity. If you've updated to the newest iTunes 8.0, you'll see his work in the vastly improved visualizer.

EDIT: Unfortunately, it's using an autoplaying video. For the sake of sanity, I've taken the embed out but you can click [here](http://www.barbariangroup.com/posts/843-robert_spoke_at_fitc_about_processing) to see it.
