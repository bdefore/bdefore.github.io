Version 1.2.1:
- Some UI fixes with the config panel
- Shared Objects weren't working reliably - they should now
- Built with MTASC - this meant the troublesome mCom components had to go...
- Update to newest tween libraries

Version 1.2.0:

New features:
- User Profile Panel: Clicking on a buddy icon now opens up the new User Profile section, which gives you quick access to more information on the photographer, their favorites, and now a legitimate display of their photosets.
- Quickly view a grid of previous photos: this was a feature/bug that had been available for a long time by hovering to the right side of the screen. It's now properly encapsulated into a button down by the userstrips.
- Search history: Go back to any search you made, viewing a list of the most recent. It will even remember searches from your previous visits. Try it out by clicking the either the down arrow in the thumbnail container or by using the new button nearby the userstrips.
- Running newest builds of Flashr and Fuse = snappier tweens and faster, cacheable data requests.
- Adding to favorites now displays confirmation
- A new spinning square when the photo enlargement is loading in! (ok, so why save the best for last, anyway?)

Bug fixes:
- FlapprLinks have received a long-overdue renovation
- Pagination issues are resolved (this was previously a headache for favorites/photosets)
- Repositioning after a browser resize now more accurate
- Keyboard shortcuts no longer interfere with comment form
- Hover boxes no longer appear over photos without titles
- Text overflows, while not entirely gone, are greatly minimized

Version 1.1.3:
 - Keyboard shortcuts added. More docs later.
 - Preloader animations for thumbnails now simpler and quicker
 - Accessibility fix: "Go" arrow button nearby the search bar - the enter
key still also activates search request
 - Mouse detection near the related/popular tags has been improved
 - Bug fix: Photographer's name shows up at the bottom of the image
enlargement even on the first photo you view by them. Before this would
not happen on the first image due to the way user information was
loaded.
 - Bug fix: Clicking a related/popular tag now appropriately restarts you
at page 1 of the following results.

Version 1.1.2:
 - Now opens up with a thumb box containing notable photos from a random
date of 2005

Version 1.1.1:
 - User searches now include popular tags underneath the search bar (in
the same location that a tag search would display related tags)
 - Thumb container now presents a more appropriate headline above the
thumbs
 - Bug fix: When looking at either favorites or photosets, hitting the
next / prev page buttons would bring you back to a previous search. This
has been fixed.
 - Bug fix: most recently viewed image could not be selected when in
zoomed - out - index - of - all - photos mode. 
 - External Flappr links broke during the shfit to version 1.1.0. Even
when they were working before, they were extremely verbose. Now
FlapprLinks work fine and weigh in about half the length of before.

Version 1.1.0:
 - Many graphical adjustments. Search area is now a bar with options
underneath, thumb container moves directly under the options.
 - On lower resolutions, the user strips would obstruct images of vertical
aspect. This has been fixed.
 - Selecting a tag in the header of the thumb container box removes that
tag and reperforms the search without it.
 - Hover box comes up with photo title.
 - Clicking a userstrip's icon displays the user's most - recent photos.
 - You can now specify which page of results you want. The page report has
now moved down by the prev / next buttons.
 - Image descriptions now match the aspect of the photo - previously
vertically aligned photos would have descriptions that spilled over the
right side
 - HTML is now supported within image descriptions
 - Employs newest Flashr build's support of cached data requests (should
help significantly if you hit the 'prev' button or otherwise search for
something you've already searched for)

Version 1.0.6:
 - Worked out the pagination bug with Kelvin and updated to the newest
Flashr build. Now the next and prev buttons will work fine when you have
authenticated.

Version 1.0.5:
 - Flags galore
 - Related tags now come up nearby the search bar
 - Related tags can now be added to your previous tag search
 - Limiting searches to "match all" now works properly
 - Now using an Entities class from meychi.com to convert entities to
chars in the photo descriptions.
 - Bug resolved where long image comments would break the hover state
 - Bug resolved where clicking an image would make it disappear
 - Updated to newest Fuse and Flashr libraries 

Version 1.0.4:
 - Photo descriptions now show when you hover over an image.

Version 1.0.3:
 - Began implementation of ResultsSet found in the newest Flashr build.
While most noticeable by the addition of the total page count now in the
thumb box, it also has resolved a few issues where the current page of
thumbs wasn't persisting/resetting correctly. i.e. now when you click on
a tag from a user's strip, the resulting search won't break if you were
previously several pages deep in the thumbnail box.
 - The authentication process is simpler for those who don't do it
initially upon page load - now the "Add to Faves" button under the image
will be ghosted if you are not authenticated, and upon hover will state
that authentication is required, and upon clicking will bring the About
panel to focus where you can authenticate. This will soon evolve into an
Authentication panel all its own.
 - Buttons unavailable are now ghosted, rather than entirely missing.
 - Related tag cloud overlap issue, introduced in 1.0.2, is now resolved.
 - Bug resolved where the "prev" button hung out in space when you'd
reached the last page in the thumb box
 - Optimization to new version of tween library, other fixes elsewhere.

Version 1.0.2:
 - Thumb box now displays as many rows as your browser height is capable
of fitting.
 - Fixed positioning of authentication buttons and clarified the
description of the process.
 - No more mixing of harsh and rounded edges - round all ound now.
 - Background now remains in position and scales with browser window.

Version 1.0.1:
 - Added a secret place to hover and find your previous photo
enlargements.
 - Thumb box should be 1024 friendly now.

Version 1.0.0:
 - Launch
