## Blurb

I've guided companies big and small to build/buy what they need, chase the right things, and enjoy the journey. I'm a scholar of agile and a listener and faciliator of tailored approaches to training, retrospectives and recruiting. I'm pretty good at breaking big things into small things and keeping the flow going.

By default I am highly autonomous, but achieve more and have fun with teams. I'm fulfilled by being a good mentor, both on-site and remote. I'm a not-so-bad generalist, pick things up quickly and support across wide areas.

My speciliazations as a contributor are steeped in web technologies. I've spent five years within React and its ecosystem and am versed in recent evolutions including hooks, TypeScript, Electron, and Gatsby. I've built Node.js systems for authentication, data processing, and serverside rendering. More recently have built cloud-based or serverless options through tools such as Firebase. I can help kickstart (or contribute to) useful maintainable testing and build systems of many flavors.
