Squible Alpha 2.5 Release Notes


Well, its about time I released something new for you all, so here ye go - Squible Alpha 2.5! What happened to 2.3 and 2.4? They existed, but were never released publically. And since there are so many changes in this version, I think it justified a couple of version number jumps. Because of all the changes, it's highly recommended that you replace the entire theme with this one, but as usual a list of changed files is below. At least, I think those are the only ones I changed.

As always, I've tested this as much as I can but there may very well be bugs in it. If you come across anything untoward in using it, please let us know in the Squible discussion forum!

Enjoy!

New Stuff:

- All new easy-configure elements! Use squible_options.php to define where certain elements sit on the main Squible page. Customization made easy! Or something.
- Added the Livesearch box to post pages
- Added $allowed_html variable to squible_options.php to define which HTML tags are allowed to be displayed in the top post on the home page (all are stripped by default)
- Added a page template for Post Archives without Extended Live Archives (named "Post Archives (Generic)")
- Added a screenshot of the theme in action (for compatibility with the upcoming Wordpress 2.0)

Changed Stuff:

- Fixed Livesearch functionality in pages that aren't the front page
- Corrected typo in livesearch.php
- Corrected typo in single.php
- Removed Gallery page template due to incompatibility - a new version will be added eventually!
- Modified Post Archives for Extended Live Archives page template to more accurately represent its requirements
- Improved error messages on theme install if certain files are missing
- ..and probably some other stuff that I've forgotten I'd fixed
