Shouldn't finding radio stations online be easier? Based on the Adobe AIR runtime, Antenna tries to alleviate that. Using a vast list of stations combined with a map interface, you can discover, listen to, and switch between thousands of stations effortlessly. Search is possible by country or genre, or just by clicking on a location on the map. Beyond that you have a history of recently-listened stations and can even rate the ones you like and return to them easily later.

To install, first grab [Adobe AIR](http://get.adobe.com/air), then download the [Antenna installer file](Antenna_v1.5.0.air). If you still have issues installing, let me know in the comments.

Changes in Version 1.5 (November 17, 2011):
- Fix for application failing to start, hanging on 'Gathering station list...' after updating to AIR 3.0
