<b>A Blown Fuse</b>

<pre>
when he looks up
his gaze meets concrete dust
he closes his lids around the sting
he sees no more but he feels no pain

his mourning switch is toggled remotely
he is a tragedy receptacle
he is sorry but his inbox is full
long ago his sorrow seratonin emptied

long before big buildings fell
	 or children shot each other
	 or a princess died

none of these are his grief
he is sorry but he is full
there is no more to give

while his friends die in smaller steel cages
while his father capitulates, slowly poisoned
while his sensors crumble from all the shouting
while he wishes for tangibility

while the letterheads swivel around him
he crouches down,
clasps two fists of concrete dust
stands
and pours it into his eyes
