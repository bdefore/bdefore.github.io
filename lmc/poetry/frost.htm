<b>Frost in Tacoma</b>

<pre>
Realize now that trains usually
Bring passengers from place to place
There is one that goes to a half-place
A half-place where the ground cannot breathe
Through its face maked up with tar
Trees line up, military fashion
Competing with steel in a verticle game
That long ago, tensile wood lost

Rhyme be the rigor, not the play, of these streets
Amidst their grid fashion, no fashion at all.
Beauty trapped in windows for purchase
All is transient here, for the slow hand of the creator
Succumbs to the hand of Man.
Handshakes, smiles, dole out indoors
Remain something short of criminal outdoors
In this half-place, community is letting another pass
To busily bus somewhere but here.
