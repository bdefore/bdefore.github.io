<p>Where do I begin from where I am? How do I connect the dots, like some mathematical 
  quiz that requires me to make a Hamiltonian path from here to there, without 
  retracing any steps, yet covering them all. I know that some problems of this 
  kind are unsolvable.</p>
<p>Let me continue nonetheless. Soon I will have a poem that will express this 
  more succinctly, LoL, but for now let me attmpt: you should know that as much 
  as Luna, Not, and Oh seem to capture your analysis, so does Cadavre capture 
  Sam's. You must not look too far. Luna Told Me is at once about you and Sam 
  both. Not Here is about both you and Sam and my search for home and the search 
  for my relationship with my father. Oh, Ryan strangely enough is not really 
  about either of you so much as my own connection with that favorite constellation. 
  There are bits and pieces of you in it of course, but as I must forewarn anyone 
  who looks too deeply, I barb every one of my poems with at least one mistruth. 
  At once this makes me feel like a liar and a coward, accusations I have had 
  to accept already... Regardless I am sure that there are important times when 
  it is correct to be either or both, and my poetry at the moment revolves around 
  that philosophy. Immoral perhaps for a greater moral: that no one feel the 100% 
  inspiration in a world where that is impossible.</p>
<p>And yet perhaps this reflects my own ambiguity that confuses myself and you 
  and Sam and my family and everyone around me. What can I do? Should I shake 
  the very foundation of this logic? Poetry for me cannot be a truth board. The 
  truth is at once: vain, cliche'd, insulting, self-deprecating, blunt, and authoritative. 
  All of these things are bad in the wrong place, and so I chip away at truth 
  in poetry, replace them with alternate endings and what if's... Perhaps my principal 
  mistakes of recent note are due more to the fact that I have lost the divider 
  that kept poetry from my reality, and I did not recognize that I do not have 
  such liberty when real people, not characters, are involved. I have always made 
  it a point to learn from mistakes, perhaps all the way to new faults, but like 
  the pendulum I do find the middle I am looking for.</p>
<p>With that as preamble, Alix, know that you were the primary inspiration for 
  the majority of my poems. </p>
<p>In this way, I wonder how much damage I have done, while simultaneously knowing 
  that it is immeasurable. All the while you wonder if Sam reads what you write 
  to me, I wonder if Sam reads what I write to you, and if you read what I write 
  to Sam. We are at a dangerous stage if we doubt each other simultaneously. I 
  take care to keep our conversations ours, while also not deceiving either you 
  or Sam as to the whole 'what do i want' question... which of course is a question 
  i pain to make absolute. </p>
<p>I would apologize for my postmodern indecision but I know you would not accept 
  it. Yes, I thank you. </p>
<p>Disappearing is worse than death, the Gravicembalo poem will soon speak to 
  that.
<p>will not be scarce,<br />

How can she write poetry that says exactly what she means?  Is she not afraid or ashamed?  She's not.  Why am I, then?  Why 
can't I ask you who you wrote Luna Told Me for?  I want to know these things but I'm too afraid to ask.  It's not my place.  
Perhaps that's the key--you will tell what you're asked.  It's my fault for not asking.

<p>So what about Luna Told Me? And what about Not Here, Sorry?  And what about Oh, Ryan?  What DO they mean?  Are they for me 
or for her?  Is there any part of you that belongs to me and not to her?  Was there ever?  She's running in on the poetry, 
taking it and making it hers, and frightening me, and I am clawing to make myself smaller and less in your eye, less in hers.
  If I could disappear I would.  

<p>Have I awakened you so that you could be with her?  What a bitter gift, this charm!

<p>And does she read this over your shoulder?  Does this too belong to her?  Am I the ghost of a lover?  I feel as if I were 
dead and haunting the bereaved.  Should I be exorcised?  

<p>I couldn't help but watch you embrace in the fog as I drove away.  I nearly got myself run into.  I wish I had.  

<p>I wish I had.  I WISH I HAD.

I'm carried on my own energy.  That's as it should be.  The combination of rehearsal, auditions, quite a bit of caffeine and 
the Trail atmosphere really got the blood running in my veins and in my brain.  I love that state.  You looked a bit more 
normal, which also made me happy.  

<p>As it becomes increasingly difficult to hold a conversation in which mine is the only voice, I'm running out of things to 
say.  Running out of words.  It will come to a point where we never say anything about anything important, and although I 
think you'd be happy with that, I don't think it's a good place to be.  But I need to remember to be patient.  It's hard--you 
know I'm not a patient person.  What I want, I want now.  Comes of being a spoiled child.  Well, I'm trying.  I'm learning.

saw you in the cafe yesterday.  hello.

<p>I completely forgot what I had meant to put here.  Except maybe that you don't need to worry about me, if you even did.  
I'm going to be all right.  Perhaps you always knew that, and that's why you weren't worried.  Or maybe I'm just guessing 
and every guess is completely wrong.  Intuition out the window.  I'll bet you think it's fun to see how right or wrong I am 
about you, either because i'm right and it pains you, or i'm wrong and you get some kind of perverse pleasure from believing
you're too screwed up in the head for <i>anyone</i> to understand you.  Either way, you're in a position of complete power 
because you get to read all this, and see into my head, (which I'm freely letting you do,) and you can be silent.  I'll tell 
you, being in the dark makes me feel cold.

The reason I'm trying to put a form up here is to have you contribute too.  You don't talk to me.  You don't tell me 
anything.  I understand that you're going through a lot right now and trying to figure things out, but I hope that 
eventually you'll be able to talk again.

Happy Birthday, loveykins.

<p>I'm not sure whether you meant your birthday was yesterday or today, by the way.  I said happy birthday yesterday and I 
say it again today.  

<p>things frighten me.  most of all, the dullness of life.  the ease of my withdrawal from its embrace.  i am struggling to 
find its beauty; this is the most important of all things.  meanwhile, i am frustrated that my appointment at chws is not till 
thursday, and wondering how many times i can die in the time between now and then.

<p>when you said it hadn't occurred to you why i was telling you about this, i thought maybe i shouldn't have mentioned it 
in the first place, because i'd put it into your head that i was trying to hurt you.  i'm not.  i feel i am exposed to you 
and your criticism, disapproval and condescension, as much as you were exposed to me last night.  i can't keep something so 
dangerous a secret from the whole world, because then it would be all too easy to convince myself i'm right and go through with 
it.  so i choose to tell you, you who have been witness more than anyone else to the pain and confusion i've been going 
through.

<p>i'm not being dramatic when i say i've come dangerously close.  the idea of dripping blood into a waste basket until i 
pass out is not one i have a problem with.  the only thing stopping me at this point is the dullness of my knife.  it's 
dangerous to be alone, but i have no one to look to.  it must seem a strange choice--that i choose you to be my strength at 
this time that we can barely look at each other--and even i can't explain it.  lots of things are mixed up in my head and 
in my heart, and i may never know exactly what motivated me to stay and not run.  

<p>sorry for the Wal-Mart pep talk.  i realize it was terribly cliched.  but sometimes the truth is a cliche.  we can't run 
from a cliche that tells us to "buck up" and try because "we can do anything we set our minds to," because running from that 
means embracing desolate reality, pessimism, and death (of the soul, not the body).<p>
