<pre>
chance that
as i comb the world-wide
not right away
but with perseverence and
the hope that lies in the second page
i find my target:
a disappointing poem
from a source known for more
such is often the case for us
except for that day of summer rendezvous
in the obscure vermont bookstore
whose digital version now offers me
mediocrity through the world-wide
where i am lost not by the words i've found,
but bye memory, googled
