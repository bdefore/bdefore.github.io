<BODY><FONT face=courier><B>One Razor</B><BR>
<PRE>when i asked you to shave my face
seven beardhairs flew off onto your cheeks

i knew you'd cut me
it didn't stop me

i knew we'd wince and smile together
you had to - "gentle means worse"
i have tricked you, i hope that you are grateful
  i had to - "gentle means worse"

remember you didn't stop or end early
         you sd you'd finish even if it meant killing me.

sorry dear, we made a blood pact now
when next you use that razor

you kut me

short of finishing anything

</PRE></FONT></BODY></HTML>
