<b>The Military Turnpike</b>

<pre>
Toll gates were originally called "turnpikes," because in
Medieval times there were actually poles or pikes that
turned on a post to admit travelers. In time, roads with
limited access for which a fee was charged came to be 
known as turnpikes.

Here is where it starts:
Here is the Military Turnpike that mobilized the minutemen and
   now mobilizes us to malls and movies;
Here is where we're speeding up our slowing down;
Here is the young house that { Luke } lived, and later the house
   that Leukemia chose;
Here is the porcelain { Jesus }, front of the house of Joe Wood;
Here is the farthest I would bike at 10;
Here is where 74 maximum-capacity schoolkids stared at the
   accident;

Here is where { Donald }, noble troublemaker, ended;

Here is graduation night's trailer party-knuckle-fist-head,
   diploma, pain;
Here is the best hill for sunset at turning;
Here is where the snow pillow caught my { Chevrolet };
Here is the turn where I'd say bufalloooooo from the backseat,
   they're gone now for me to trust in the weathered asphalt of
   memory;
Here is Love Hate River, i hate how you're always right, there;
Here is where I'm slowing down my speeding up;
Here is where you can go 55 (65) again;
Here is where it ends.

I turn off the Military Turnpike, I can't help but look at the
corner, where a century ago, the gateman would lift the entry pole.
Donald paid the toll for us last year. His head's there on the pole.
Who will pay this year? Do mean roads like these have an end?
