<p>: kachunk )

<p>this was the last phrase jim messaged me tonight. a smiley face ripped in half, how ironic he says. hockey didn't help. (but you would think me funny with big schwarzenegger paddded shoulders)... he's visibly affected by his grandfather's death, such a source of ironman constancy (2 heart attacks, 1 stroke... a living example of North Country resiliency) ... but in the mind it is hardest to be resilient, and we question big questions when circumstances of big final answers come about.

<p>even this place, without so many new additions of burger kings and blockbusters to measure by... it has its changes... ever so slowly and unannounced, for you to analyze beyond where you should. this place is dying. i have left and so has jim and so does everyone of nobility and intelligence. this place is lost, has lost, me. did it ever really have me?

<p>"i'm going to heaven" he said ... but the nurses resucitated him for a final 7 days of mostly unconscious life, for his eyeballs to set into his skull... "looked like a concentration camp victim." yep... there's the death of an old man, or the death of a small town, for all it ever was.

<p>winter. it's all winter's fault that i think ponder things. but it is a graveyard here after all. thank fortune for sweet reminders, like sugar cookies, and christmas trees left up beyond xmas, and 16 year old cats that insist on sleeping on your stomach, and sisters, and hugs, and loyalty, and ... *i'm sitting here thinking, biting my lip unconsciously*

<p>where to take it from here? i am somber, fully pulled back now into the slow life that this place enstills. the pace of tacoma feels like another me, or not me. am i going to surprise you? am i simply not solid, fixed, cohesive... too malleable, moody, numb, eaten by postmodernism, to be anything right now?

<p>i strum a guitar and watch soccer games and let the time pass. and i am passed. and i am past.

<p>'Twas the night before Xmas, and all through the house...
<br>nothing that rhymes with 'house' gets across the idea that I feel very alone on Christmas this year.

<p>Of course there are people all around me.  I spent a good part of today visiting my aunt, and I'm amazed at how warm she becomes when she sees me as an adult instead of the child of her sister.  And how generous.  And the Dai Zovis are home tonight, and tomorrow I'm going climbing in Socorro before coming back for Christmas dinner at their house.  I have thirteen presents to open (such a lucky number)--my mother went kind of crazy, I suppose to compensate for my not being home for Christmas.  

<p>But there is no one here whom I feel attached to, with whom to share smiles and hugs and gifts.  Though I can't say I want to be in Alabama right now, which is where I'd have to be to spend Xmas with my folks, I still would like to be with them.  

<p>The luminarias are out in force tonight.  Old town is lit with them and the lights are surely bright enough to guide the Magi or Santa Claus or a B-52 bomber directly to the heart of our suburban sprawl.  No--it's beautiful and I have no reason to be cynical.  

<p>The graveyard needs a new name.  I haven't found one yet.  It will come someday, as the name of the Imp struck suddenly after years of namelessness.

<p>Lacking anything better with which to close this, I will simply stop.

<p>I see a pattern here. I am posting farther and farther into the mornings. And I'm supposed to be adjusting to EST?

<P>I was thinking that if it irked you, the irkable one, o' recipient of irking, then perhaps it would serve to de-irk somewhat, lessen the irking, reduce the irkability, if i renovated the graveyard and contributed my own piece a mere two hours later? However, perhaps that is not much irksolation when it is, by the mere fact of things, a day after your post. I'm afraid I am a male, therefore genetically unable to impress wholly. Boo-hoo and zug zug and all that.

<p>Yes, merry seasoned seasons to you. X-Mas approaches (how fun to abbreviate the sanctity of the name) and it all rushes quickly, and in much of the same ambivalence as always on this front. I suppose it's hard to argue any other way. But nonetheless I feel pinings as it appears you do also... it is a time to be with loved ones, n'est-ce pas? If so then how can I resolve this transcontinental challenge? Uh-oh... I've confessed too much to the likes of a logician like yourself. Let me introduce you to my Big Brother...

<p><i>Hello. How are you today. My day was fine. Everyone is happy. The weather was lovely today. A bit warmer than usual. I smiled at my parents today. They smiled at me. My cat did not vomit on my carpet today. There are many things to be grateful for.</i>

<p>All right, enough of that. I have more to say perhaps uncensored. I am torn by your confession of photogenicity. Those days are worth living to their fullest. Do save a few for our next meeting! I love to see you at your finest. I am also on a mission. As likely as the inanimate hat can capture your beauty, I reason: so too can the inanimate lens. Then again, you see what you want to see, and I have little more to add to the subject in the form of words. Perhaps photos, that are mine for an instance and then yours for-ever.

<p>It is funny that you mention your friends' reactions about you regarding the relationship. You must remember our last day, when we were in the cafe with Ken, Lacey, and Julie. You see, we were too obvious about our gazes, over things like bananas, salads, et al. Lacey nudged me after you left and asked, "Are you in love?" I could not help but remark, "Such strong language?!" She is such a gossiping romantic asitwere. Then again, when I thought about it... it is nice, this feeling I have, even if it is assumption, that you also have the armadillo skin to respond, if not in those exact words, then with equal panache. Sometimes, however, what is hidden shows through, and I am not sure what to do. I ask you, as I offer you my own rose for the graveyard, how should we respond? The next question is up over yonder, I am certain. They may just bring cameras! Wait... don't melt yet! How will I separate you from the petals in the snow at our feet?

<pre>........

<p>It irks me to post on the same day as you, because it looks as though I await your posts with baited breath, as though I am unable to live my life without running back to the computer and spreading it out before you and knowing you see it.  Do I live my life only to lay it like roses in the graveyard?

<p>It feels as though I do.  I'd say I feel I've lost control of myself, that i've abandoned my heart to the whim of another, but of course it isn't true.  My eyes have always been open.

<p>My friends laugh at me when I say I'm not in a relationship.  I suppose I've been acting as though I am.  Is this something I should try to avoid?  To change?  Am I too attached?  It's difficult not to be.  Not because I feel I'm not up to the challenge, but because I haven't seen a reason to try.

<p>I'm photogenic today.  It's not inherently pleasing.  More displeasing, because you're not here to see me on one of the rare days when I like what <i>I</i> see.  We were at the Bon Marche and I put on a hat that was way too expensive but which looked so good, and I wanted it so much because then I could carry with me the image in the mirror, the image I saw of someone who could be called pretty.  But the hat doesn't make the beauty; it only captures it, I suppose--the hat is a tangible symbol of an elusive and protean self-esteem.  I feel if I owned the hat I would hold my beauty in my hands.

<p>Amazing.  I never worried so much about my appearance before I fell in love with you.  Shouldn't it be the other way around?

<p>so if you're not busy keeping me, sifting me, i have another request. to hear my mundane story of the moment, via the graveyard. i hope you enjoy.

<p>all is well from the homefront, as much as it can be. the preachings from the summer have subsided. father/son talk goes relatively smoothly. he showed me a menu from his old bar/hotel which he owned for a few years before a competitor arsoned it. quaintness abounded, beyond just the 35 cent cheeseburgers. there is much that happens in a life i suppose. my dad may finally be showing a little bit more of his own. as much as my research of the past has shown that i enjoy the simple uncrecognized idiosyncrasies, i'm not sure that he's ever known this. we'll see if it continues. at this point he is fighting the flu, along with the whole family. my mother mentioned softly at one point, 'this must be how your father feels all the time.' perhaps so, perhaps so. his arms seem to get thinner by the day, the cruel process of a slow-but-sure death have their way with his body. his legs swell with some syndrome beginning with an 'a', and his kidney makes walking and otherwise locomoting a challenging process.

<p>what does this account have to do with the graveyard? perhaps nothing. perhaps everything. perhaps sincerity is all.

<p>my friend Jim arrives from ft. lauderdale tomorrow... it will be good to have him home again. we'll probably waste our time away playing NHL video games and drinking a few beers, talking about life on opposite coasts. you know, those friends who never seem to say goodbye and seem to pick up right where you left off when you last went separate ways.

<p>funny, i just thought of this entry as a "primary document". even easier to sift then.

<p>tonight, i picked up some subs from the local 'mountain mart' and lo and behold by the time i arrived back from the pink sunset i had lost all apetite, as had everyone else. there is something tribal and comforting to know everyone is sick along with you. so the subs sat in the fridge for a few hours before we munched a few small portions. it helped a bit. here's hoping some sleep will do good also. maybe the cat's are sick too. tiger, loving as she is, hacked up all the wet food considerately at the foot of my bed. i kicked her out for an hour or so, but who am i kidding? i'm not really that harsh with my cats. they hunch a bit more than they used to, and i treat them like i would the others of the house, in consolation for the great age and slow movings of this land. fascinating. where is I-5? wouldn't fit here that's for sure.

<p>kristina. what do you take of all this? is this real?

<pre>........
12.19.02     9:13 p.m. PST
........</pre>

<p>i am usually so good at sifting, though usually in complete sentences.  i don't know if i can now.  general thoughts come 
bubbling up but there doesn't seem to be an answer, The Answer.  It's still floating and slippery.  I'm just going to write 
and hope you can take some sense from it.  your posts are slippery too, and in some places i can see through them like crystal, 
and in others i am left to wonder and to roll the words over my tongue again and again.

<p>it slowly sinks in, this concept of 3,000 miles.  Strange things, like bananas in the SUB, remind me of you.  I don't know 
what to do with myself, i'm so accustomed to spending time with you.  yet i don't feel lovesick.  it feels so strange to be 
devoid of hurt, but then i remember the reason for the change: not because you left, but because of what happened before you 
left.  Those last two days i felt as emotionally calm as I do now, but now I feel... unfocused.  Like a camera being pointed 
at the wrong things.

<p>difficult to know what's going on in my own head.  part of me says it's perfectly acceptable to consider this idea of 'seeing 
other people.'  because we said we weren't going out, right?  though it felt so much like it, and so natural, so right, when 
you were here, and the happiest moments of my life were those in which you reached out to me and kissed me, and those in which 
i could see that you weren't ashamed or guilty.  finally accepting the state of things, when you've been biting at the wind 
for a month.  you told me that that day was wonderful... you know, that is the way things should have been all month.  no.  the 
way things WOULD have been if not for Sam.  I say would instead of should because I'm not bitter or wistful.  things happened 
as they happened and i feel a little less naive, a little more confident in my romanticism. 

<p>course, understanding reality means expecting to get hurt if i'm going to open myself open the way I do.  i expect a life 
of emotional pain.  this is one reason why i need to avoid depression, because depression + pain = bad news.  we know.

<p>patience and a lack of expectations.  the only answers for me.  i've had high expectations of you ever since i met you, 
because i knew you were capable of meeting them.  i'm learning that just because you're capable of something doesn't mean the 
time is right for it.  Life gets in the way.  Things... get in the way.  i could very easily let sam upset me, let your feelings 
for her weaken me with jealousy and sadness.  but now is not the time for these feelings.  and i am too strong and too rational 
(yes, rational) for them.  i know when to resist the reactions any other human being would be led to.  

<p>as much as i want to know what you're thinking and feeling about everything, i don't belong in your head.  and we have no 
obligations to each other, but give freely.  I have no right to jealousy, and in any case the idea of jealousy makes me ill. 
as though you belong to anyone but yourself.  

<p>but please, what you do give, let it be real.  let it be you.  i know there are things you don't tell me; give me at least 
this stable ground, or i will never know you.  i know so little of you as it is.  strange that despite this i put so much 
faith in you.  (i know... so much pressure!  i don't mean it that way.  this is just what spills out onto the page.)

<p>'Keep me,' you say.  There are plenty of reasons why I shouldn't.  I don't buy any of them.  I such a way I embrace folly; in 
such a way I laugh into the wind.  (and yet, I still haven't answered The Question.  It's so complicated.)

<p>I tuck away from your MSN likeness to scratch a few scrawlings in the magnolia graveyard. I wonder how this is possible. 
Does it require the compulsive arranging of leaves? Fallen petals? Why is this still a graveyard? Does a new season never 
touch this place and restore its vitality?

<p>You must know that the output of passion is like any other output - and it shares with all the characteristic I suffer at 
the moment: where to put it all, that which I have trained so well the last month? It has today outpoured into my new sexy 
guitar. But it is mere wood. I cannot kiss it. Okay I did, but it doesn't kiss back. What to do in this liminal state, where 
I bounce from substitute to substitute. Denying sugar-substitutes in my coffee. Coffee and cigarettes surround me. The spoils
 of a civilization that knows how to gratify itself. Perhaps this is why I have never felt attached. Does this mean I should 
strive for high goals? Measure myself by standard measuring systems? Flock to the eccentric, iconoclastic out of spite? Or 
get consumed by it: sugar, love, nicotene, death, poetry, japanese culture. Oh, answer me Walter Mondale.

<p>What does this say of you and me? Chickens and tigers and tyrants have been known not to know. You know. Kristina, I 
ramble. Keep me. Show me what sifts. Tell me in your own words, completely incomplete sentences.

<p>My mind stab-jabs with the heat/heart of a bored jabberwocky. I am here. I am home. I am selfish. I must stop.

<pre>........

<p>I both wanted and feared your presence at the party last night.  Ken said you'd gone to dinner with Sam 'an hour and a 
half ago' and that you'd be back, and this was at around 9:30, I think.  But you were never there.  Granted, I was at Zach's 
house for a long time, but you weren't there when I came back either.  I can't help but be bothered by that--but when I think 
about it, I realize I'd be upset if you <i>were</i> there, because (a) Sam would be there too, or (b) I'd have to be near you 
and not be able to touch you.  It was bad enough waking up in the morning and seeing you on the floor and slinking out like an 
intruder.  There's no way for me to have avoided sadness, though I think this way was the best way--that you weren't there 
at all, and I could pretend not to be thinking about you, and drink a hell of a lot of liquor (4 shots of rum and two Mike's).
And I did some things maybe I shouldn't have done last night, though I knew what I was doing.  But I digress.

<p>I'm very tired.  I'm going to eat some cereal and go to sleep.  When I left your house this morning I went to the SUB, and 
I guess I must have been thirsty because I bought a gatorade, a Snapple, a bottle of apple juice and a bottle of lemonade.  
Should have drunk that glass of water.

<p>Sadness.  I am forever embracing you in my mind.  Why can't you be more of a dick?  When are we going to watch 
<i>The Wall</i>?  Are you really leaving in five days?  What's going to happen when you leave?  Who have I become through all 
this?  Will you ever figure things out?  Will I ever understand you?  No, I do understand you.  Can I ever accept that you 
are who you are independently of me?  Can I ever forget you?  Can I ever exist again independently of you?  Can this be life--
this tragedy of errors, this betrayal and sad inevitability and battle of wills and loves?  Will I ever be able to overcome 
the hurt of knowing I was the loser in the most important contest of my life?  What does it really mean that I woke you up?

<p>Now I'm falling into anguish.  I must sleep or I might do something reckless.

<p>:Alix:


<pre>........
12.10.02     2:02 p.m. (for those who appreciate biography)
........</pre>
<p>Where do I begin from where I am? How do I connect the dots, like some mathematical 
  quiz that requires me to make a Hamiltonian path from here to there, without 
  retracing any steps, yet covering them all. I know that some problems of this 
  kind are unsolvable.</p>
<p>Let me continue nonetheless. Soon I will have a poem that will express this 
  more succinctly, LoL, but for now let me attmpt: you should know that as much 
  as Luna, Not, and Oh seem to capture your analysis, so does Cadavre capture 
  Sam's. You must not look too far. Luna Told Me is at once about you and Sam 
  both. Not Here is about both you and Sam and my search for home and the search 
  for my relationship with my father. Oh, Ryan strangely enough is not really 
  about either of you so much as my own connection with that favorite constellation. 
  There are bits and pieces of you in it of course, but as I must forewarn anyone 
  who looks too deeply, I barb every one of my poems with at least one mistruth. 
  At once this makes me feel like a liar and a coward, accusations I have had 
  to accept already... Regardless I am sure that there are important times when 
  it is correct to be either or both, and my poetry at the moment revolves around 
  that philosophy. Immoral perhaps for a greater moral: that no one feel the 100% 
  inspiration in a world where that is impossible.</p>
<p>And yet perhaps this reflects my own ambiguity that confuses myself and you 
  and Sam and my family and everyone around me. What can I do? Should I shake 
  the very foundation of this logic? Poetry for me cannot be a truth board. The 
  truth is at once: vain, cliche'd, insulting, self-deprecating, blunt, and authoritative. 
  All of these things are bad in the wrong place, and so I chip away at truth 
  in poetry, replace them with alternate endings and what if's... Perhaps my principal 
  mistakes of recent note are due more to the fact that I have lost the divider 
  that kept poetry from my reality, and I did not recognize that I do not have 
  such liberty when real people, not characters, are involved. I have always made 
  it a point to learn from mistakes, perhaps all the way to new faults, but like 
  the pendulum I do find the middle I am looking for.</p>
<p>With that as preamble, Alix, know that you were the primary inspiration for 
  the majority of my poems. </p>
<p>In this way, I wonder how much damage I have done, while simultaneously knowing 
  that it is immeasurable. All the while you wonder if Sam reads what you write 
  to me, I wonder if Sam reads what I write to you, and if you read what I write 
  to Sam. We are at a dangerous stage if we doubt each other simultaneously. I 
  take care to keep our conversations ours, while also not deceiving either you 
  or Sam as to the whole 'what do i want' question... which of course is a question 
  i pain to make absolute. </p>
<p>I would apologize for my postmodern indecision but I know you would not accept 
  it. Yes, I thank you. </p>
<p>Disappearing is worse than death, the Gravicembalo poem will soon speak to 
  that.
<p>will not be scarce,<br />

How can she write poetry that says exactly what she means?  Is she not afraid or ashamed?  She's not.  Why am I, then?  Why 
can't I ask you who you wrote Luna Told Me for?  I want to know these things but I'm too afraid to ask.  It's not my place.  
Perhaps that's the key--you will tell what you're asked.  It's my fault for not asking.

<p>So what about Luna Told Me? And what about Not Here, Sorry?  And what about Oh, Ryan?  What DO they mean?  Are they for me 
or for her?  Is there any part of you that belongs to me and not to her?  Was there ever?  She's running in on the poetry, 
taking it and making it hers, and frightening me, and I am clawing to make myself smaller and less in your eye, less in hers.
  If I could disappear I would.  

<p>Have I awakened you so that you could be with her?  What a bitter gift, this charm!

<p>And does she read this over your shoulder?  Does this too belong to her?  Am I the ghost of a lover?  I feel as if I were 
dead and haunting the bereaved.  Should I be exorcised?  

<p>I couldn't help but watch you embrace in the fog as I drove away.  I nearly got myself run into.  I wish I had.  

<p>I wish I had.  I WISH I HAD.

I'm carried on my own energy.  That's as it should be.  The combination of rehearsal, auditions, quite a bit of caffeine and 
the Trail atmosphere really got the blood running in my veins and in my brain.  I love that state.  You looked a bit more 
normal, which also made me happy.  

<p>As it becomes increasingly difficult to hold a conversation in which mine is the only voice, I'm running out of things to 
say.  Running out of words.  It will come to a point where we never say anything about anything important, and although I 
think you'd be happy with that, I don't think it's a good place to be.  But I need to remember to be patient.  It's hard--you 
know I'm not a patient person.  What I want, I want now.  Comes of being a spoiled child.  Well, I'm trying.  I'm learning.

saw you in the cafe yesterday.  hello.

<p>I completely forgot what I had meant to put here.  Except maybe that you don't need to worry about me, if you even did.  
I'm going to be all right.  Perhaps you always knew that, and that's why you weren't worried.  Or maybe I'm just guessing 
and every guess is completely wrong.  Intuition out the window.  I'll bet you think it's fun to see how right or wrong I am 
about you, either because i'm right and it pains you, or i'm wrong and you get some kind of perverse pleasure from believing
you're too screwed up in the head for <i>anyone</i> to understand you.  Either way, you're in a position of complete power 
because you get to read all this, and see into my head, (which I'm freely letting you do,) and you can be silent.  I'll tell 
you, being in the dark makes me feel cold.

The reason I'm trying to put a form up here is to have you contribute too.  You don't talk to me.  You don't tell me

eventually you'll be able to talk again.

Happy Birthday, loveykins.

<p>I'm not sure whether you meant your birthday was yesterday or today, by the way.  I said happy birthday yesterday and I 
say it again today.  

<p>things frighten me.  most of all, the dullness of life.  the ease of my withdrawal from its embrace.  i am struggling to 
find its beauty; this is the most important of all things.  meanwhile, i am frustrated that my appointment at chws is not till 
thursday, and wondering how many times i can die in the time between now and then.

<p>when you said it hadn't occurred to you why i was telling you about this, i thought maybe i shouldn't have mentioned it 
in the first place, because i'd put it into your head that i was trying to hurt you.  i'm not.  i feel i am exposed to you 
and your criticism, disapproval and condescension, as much as you were exposed to me last night.  i can't keep something so 
dangerous a secret from the whole world, because then it would be all too easy to convince myself i'm right and go through with 
it.  so i choose to tell you, you who have been witness more than anyone else to the pain and confusion i've been going 
through.

<p>i'm not being dramatic when i say i've come dangerously close.  the idea of dripping blood into a waste basket until i 
pass out is not one i have a problem with.  the only thing stopping me at this point is the dullness of my knife.  it's 
dangerous to be alone, but i have no one to look to.  it must seem a strange choice--that i choose you to be my strength at 
this time that we can barely look at each other--and even i can't explain it.  lots of things are mixed up in my head and 
in my heart, and i may never know exactly what motivated me to stay and not run.  

<p>sorry for the Wal-Mart pep talk.  i realize it was terribly cliched.  but sometimes the truth is a cliche.  we can't run 
from a cliche that tells us to "buck up" and try because "we can do anything we set our minds to," because running from that 
means embracing desolate reality, pessimism, and death (of the soul, not the body).<p>
