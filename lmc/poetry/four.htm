when i was four
<br>and you were born,
<br>i might have thanked your divine engineer
<br>if i believed in...

<p>the car that brought me 4,000 miles is sold
<br>not to be trusted to survive another.
<br>maybe i should have


<p>once it brought us to a <i>buena vista</i>
<br>which i ignored
<br>concentrating, surveying your construction
<br>past your stoic eyes
<br>and into the timbers of your neck
<br>it's at trying times like these
<br>that they angle
<br>your head
<br>just
<br>so:

<p>	the peccateristic
<br>	above your left brow
<br>	vertically aligns
<br>	with your chin

<p>exactly four degrees.

<p>it's cold away from you.
