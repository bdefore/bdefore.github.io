<b>Months</b>

<pre>
twenty-seven
three to power three
what is left for two, in we?
                      us, and me?
phone call; hello far off
love take shape, hello goodbye
hello, delay, goodbye

twenty-eight
odd seven when quadrupled
leaves a two and its quadruple
anniversary not forgotten, just ignored
words clasped in midair
by a shapeless shifter
shifted oh my dear
shifting out of fear
shift into poison spear
and sent along their way

twenty-nine
super social two meets exotic nine
what’s left stands alone
the curse of (a) prime
months gone by
memory, stop searing me
i know better
months fly by but not awry
i stop counting,
but the numbers
are still there.
