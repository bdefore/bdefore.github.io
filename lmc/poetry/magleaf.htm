<b>The Trade of a Magnolia Leaf</b>

<pre>
Frosties tiptoe on blades of grass
To wink at me as I pass

A Crescent moon smirks its bashful red
As I sift through the fallen magnolia marketplace.
Frosties leap from the ground and sting my fingers

Only here can I barter my worries for three or four leaves.

	( A good deal by any standard.

Now I pass a lovely scholar of late-into-evening
And though her thoughts mix of sleep and suspicion
I trade to her a leaf for her concerns.

	the insides of her eyes slide up
	and the outsides push down
	to touch a secret smile

	acci-dental laugh bounces off the frosties.
	it escapes from her, at 2:12AM

We exchange vapored breaths and carry on.

		( A good deal by any standard.
