<BODY><FONT face=courier><B>Shelter From the Storm</B><p>
1.
<p>my pacemaker reminds me
<br>we live in that new century
<br>where the world is round, round, round
<br>the past spills at my heels
<br>and my future is a slippery slope
<br>leading somewhere unseen

<p>2.

<p>now, you with your own tuggings
<br>from a pandemonium pulse
<br>from a heartbeat that whirls wherewithal
<br>presenting: empress, priestess, star, lovers

<p>you have spun me sideways
<br>or frontways, slantways
<br>and sometimes more original oddways:

<p>one such muse thundered us into the thicket
<br>never a shrug when we realized
<br>that the newts could appreciate
<br>the downpores more than our own

<P>we took it all in
<br>buckets of rain, <i>veritas</i>
<br>i hope i haven't gotten my signals crossed
<br>just because
<br>you gave me shelter from the storm

<p>soon i'll face not the hurricane but the typhoon
<br>and i will spin counter-clockwise
<br>in the mid of night i'll go wanderwondering
<br>it'll be midnight whether it's 12 or not

<p>i'll encounter the local perfume
<br>and wonder where you are
<br>remembering you, the one struck by lightning years ago
<br>you've given me shelter from the storm
<br>and might have gotten me struck in the process

</PRE></FONT></BODY></HTML>
