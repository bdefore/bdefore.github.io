<b>Luna Told Me</b>

<pre>
1.

Amidst frosty morning mist
Witness the occasion of the moon exposing herself
So rarely does her smirking crescence admit truth
Yet even her dark side
Is not as dark as the surrounding void.

I arrived home again at half-past six.
To stare at Mistress Luna.
Leaning against my Volvo station wagon.
Confused and warmed by a Chinese communist hat.
And a United Parcel Service jacket.

2.

Symbols don't represent the totality of the story of me.
Until I blow into them the spirit of human fallibility:
Random precision / desperately vacuous profundity
So that they speak of the cracks of my mind.
In all that they do not say in yours.

Cheshire in me sd 'come now, aren't we beyond all that'
If I make these outside words misshapen your insides
Will you let me can I make you do you want to
Come on, smirk, you.
Darken the surrounding void.
