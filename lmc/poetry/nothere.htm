<b>Not Here, Sorry</b>

<pre>
home might be
where the hard is
but it's not now, here

where the temp. doesn't waver as much as my soul
in this unnovember warm

fear, not as clear
wallpocks and alabaster smocks
and everywhere, not here

candied celibate pain
falafel montage of the...

spirited off to here, not here
sorry.

wonk wonk wonk wonk
wizzing the reminder, the tape recording
considerate alarm clock
just gets louder
tells me to walk without morals
they don't apply anymore
when people are hurt anyway

taste the calcification
of my watered mind
of the nature, spilt, that won't ever happen like that again:

jool,
strawberry rhubarb,
mass production,

wod, clod, and widmer hef
fer, don't bring her into this
stubborn cow
eweizen

just say it
i'll say it
addict
addict to the up, down, sidways, slantways

i confess my terminal addiction
my emotions are tied to the stick of language

now will you mort me a petit mort?
it doesn't require much thought or non-thought
the words are there, i see them through the window

but it's cold outside.

should be.
