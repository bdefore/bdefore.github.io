<b>Oh, Ryan</b>

<pre>
			( There you are again
When my car is towed
			( There you are again
When I fetch the winter mail

Are you the force that spins my fate in this peculiar karma?
Or merely the passive rotating reminder, a reflection

In November,
			( There you are again
When I'm too far gone to notice
You sd: no prey you couldn't strike down
No single goal
You couldn't achieve
Then I look up and wince when
Come March, the cosmic Scorpio sting banishes you
Out of the zodiac and into the anonymous daylight sky

Lonelycold 3AM night
You rise again
To prove your point
But proud as you are,
The Indians thought you a bleeding doe
And the Sumerians a sheep.

			( You musn't surprise me like this

If you are so strong, hunter, lover,
Why waste your night here in this downward spiral with me
Why must you disappear for a half-year
And leave me with no mirror in the sky?
For me to learn this cycle all over again.
