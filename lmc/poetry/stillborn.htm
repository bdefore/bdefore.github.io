<b>Still Born?</b>

<pre>
It was the evening that I could finally recognize your scent.
It was the evening that I could finally read the subtle happiness in your eyes.
It was the evening that I had to let us return to strangers.

I don't want to disappear. 			Maybe that's my job then.

You left but I stood there in that spot in silence forever.
Feet growing roots because I doubted I could take another step again.
Had I not turned off the accusing fluorescence, I would have melted.

I cannot.					Why?

We may never learn the languages we might have spoken.
Already our words uncovered so much of me that I was reborn.
How few people have made the dreadful choice to abort themselves.

There's too much cynicism in the world. 	Is there room for an optimist. Or two?

Lover of language, I lack the bravery that you ask for, that you deserve.
The incomplete endeavor of our new tongue might have described how I feel now.
But I am stuck, the Pandora whose riddle was never finished, may you please forgive me.
