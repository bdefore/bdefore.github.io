<b>Cafe Cacaphoneine</b>

<pre>
fearless fingers of poor circulation
fear not the cold or the cynicism
do trace the infinity symbol on the hardwood table
you will be warmed against my belly

the elderly lady watches, vicarious smile

as we shamelessly debate the art of grammar
now i have you cornered,
lover of language
for in poetry all rules can be broken

remember these surrounding bottles of coffee flavoring
that become the slolam course
for our eyes and words 
for our unending ribbon of illogicity

one by one the bottles embrace the tale
of two split infinitives

with enough cacaphoneine
just how long can our run-on go?
