<b>The Soft/Loud Death of Gravicembalo</b>

<pre>

I.

Soft and loud.
You sing too tragically not to be
Insecure progeny of virginal, spinettina, and clavi_____
	(For that gives too much away too soon
You beset me that Italian night so long ago
While Orion hunted my sanity
Tell me,
When you stood there that first night
As your creator slept - no, that is moot
It is obvious he stayed up all night shaping you
Did you not realize what you were in for?
You are the dame that everyone dreams of
And then obsesses over
You would be the object of delight
	(and centuries of madness
In this way, dear Gravicembalo, you were born
In your wake, dear gentlemen would die the instant they touched you

II.

I know:

Your origins - a Nippon Gakki #1610727
Even before the Meiji Restoration
Your timeless spirit would not rest in Kyoto
Until revolution and form wrapped around you

Deep inside you are mere nuts and bolts
But you seem so much more
I've felt you from the inside
You offered yourself to me, but your age deserves
my respectful trepidation
For I can see your spherical screws and
Pillar knobs, a series of meticulous towers
your padded drums and triangles expanding to the left
an experiment in assymetry

I know that you gave birth to perfectionism, modernism
With your internals like a lost city of the 18th century
You evolved to some unexplained end
And before long the academics declared your chaos an order
And you were done
Soft and loud.

III.

Though you are a jewel out of your time
Your values reflect the constancy of our desires
And the inconstancy of our resolve
Forte - your forgotten last name
For as weak as you've become, you once represented inhuman strength
How can you sit there, over two centuries old,
	masquerading modern, betraying baroque, and rotting rococo?
Your reputation precedes you
You entranced me when my name was Robert, and I paralyzed my third finger
	in my desperation to better caress you
It is only the men you crush between your ivory teeth
That are blessed with martyred fame.
Only those may I tribute.
All the while I taste the same intoxication you offered me last century.

IV.

But in truth your serum,
Now impotent
Is no longer forte, but the name we all know you by today: piano
Trans: soft, not loud.
Gavicembalo you have come a long way
But your death is almost complete
The wounds of time stretch out in the form of
guitar, vinyl, radio, Internet, MIDI, mixers, digital video
How could you survive but in this haunting chrysalis?
Your art is now the art of escaping time
Leaving for the curse of Bach, Beethoven, Debussy...
And longing for your mortal romance.
