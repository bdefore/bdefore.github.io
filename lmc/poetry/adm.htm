<b>ADM - Supermarket to My Soul</b>

<pre>
I received your letter today, ADM
		( Supermarket to my soul.
The pages sifted and launched
The fragrance of our encounters.

This mystery from the mesas
Came to me in a hard shell, a happy shell
She didn't need to cook me omelettes to prove
That her inner valleys were shaped
With the heavy weight of slow time.

The girl who drove the empty family car
We'd cry and chant along to happy movies
		( blackbird singin' in the dead of night.

All our lives, or so each moment seemed
We'd escape to solitude with green chili
And politely sleep together

Maybe that is why she parted me a bag of cedar
For scent was the cure to more than we knew
Or more than we could ever know.
