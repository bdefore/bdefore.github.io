<b>Frog of Little Fanfare</b>

<pre>
i don't understand the ado over names of species. most
people now agree that placing people into names, beakers,
in order to understand them easier is not only scientific, 
it's also immoral and clouds us from seeing beyond our own 
constructions. so i'm not going to research what kind of 
little life this was called. i'll name it a spotted frog. i 
am positive that this isn't very exclusive, far from the 
disjoint sets that are required for Greater analysis. this 
doesn't bother me. at first i wanted to know if this young 
frog was a boy or a girl, but even that's not really 
important. 

more importantly, i found it pinched atop the gravel that 
makes my driveway easier to drive on. after a few days i 
thought about what i should do. some people believe that 
little lives deserve little fanfare. i can't see it any 
other way. much fanfare over little things feels not only 
contrived and self-satisfying, but also anti-entropic if 
you think about it, especially considering my situation, 
death and all.

with little declaration i sat down on the gravel and 
started to make a true-to-scale replica of the Famous 
Spotted Frog Shrine Which No One Has Ever Found. i dragged 
a circular pattern in the dirt. then i placed some pebbles 
around the perimeter. after a while i stopped using my 
opposable digit; after all, i've never seen a frog use its 
own evolutionary gift. a weedy leaf went to the center of 
the temple, and then a nearby dry blade of grass lifted the 
frog by its armpit and placed it on the soft leaf. 

i'm not sure if the frog likes it there.
