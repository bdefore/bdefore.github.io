<b>They Have No Pilots</b> 
<pre><img src="f15e_pic_crop.gif" width="118" height="172" align="right">
they roar but
they have no pilots.
scream overhead
at quarter full-speed

everyone looks up with solace
they have no pilots.
F-15's, fastest fighter in the world
cloaked in faceless steel

they're anxious to begin the feast
they have no pilots.
below, the passionate scholars ask
they have no pilots?

they have no pilots.
no! they have no pilots.

we will see where our logic ends
before we ever begin to doubt

they have no pilots.
