<PRE>Just off the boat in the promised land, the Chinese immigrant was
told at the dock that before he could be hired, he needed to learn some
fundamental things about America. Specifically, he would need to learn
the Declaration of Independence and the Pledge of Allegiance.

The manager dictated: <i>"...We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness..."</i>

His new friend, a Korean, translated for him. It sounded something like
this:

    "...Us in order to be self-explanatory this truth, it is a writing
    all male and it sleeps equally it creates, they this lifetime of
    happiness, freedom and tracking, by they creator in the unalienable
    right which is positive that it is given catches wild between..."

The Chinese man made a concerned look, wondering what "catching the
wild" entailed. He signed the papers.

The manager continued: <i>"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United
States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands; one nation,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."</i>

Again, the Korean friend translated this for him:

    "I with USA pledges the American flag is loyal the republic which
    stands; All is one country, it can divide the freedom and the process."

Now even more disturbed, the Chinese man stepped back aghast. Why should
one country have the right to divide freedom and process? Why would they
want to? Why would they want to? He signed the papers.
