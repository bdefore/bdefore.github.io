<b>The Sound of Evermore</b>

<pre>
what a distance that sound covers! not a distance
of ground, distance of heart. the dazing engineer 
started it when he pulled the emergency horn.
populated  area. saturday night. pull a little longer. the 
dizzied partygoer heard it, and he stopped for a 
second to hear (and get his bearings.) the 
insomniac heard it, and turned to her side to 
capture its lullaby. the resting lovers heard 
it, and they braced a little closer. something 
for each to celebrate, even if it is just the 
world’s wheels turning. even if it is a shrill 
steel whine conceived by a bored graveyard shifter. 
each took this howl of apathy, clothed in care, 
and recognized it as their guide for this night.
call it blue-collar pride, call it the way things
are, it is sound of evermore, and all it ever was.
