<b>Reflected InCarnations</b>

<i>co-written with Kristina Yoas</i><p><pre>
Shopping the magnolia marketplace
Bartering my worries for a leaf or three
You've got garlands spilling from your wagon
Spilling onto the street, falling softly on my feet
When the organic rests upon the confetti
Our body towers rise with worthy reflected glory
Into the streets, under high silk canopies,
Meeting with our own incarnations - floral
Wreaths of a petaled nature, for our brows
A pair of minds, eyes, coerced to open
By the violent perfection of the scent;
Connected in magnolias, buying love.
