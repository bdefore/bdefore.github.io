<b>Falling Standing Apart</b>

<pre>
24 years they stood apart
monolithic mutually-divided prosperity

until the day winged arms
armed wings of Seattle steel
nailed, screwed, disavowed elbows

one day those two arms embraced
the two towers that never could
together they slumped in shame

for pride was all that kept them up
          and all that kept them apart
