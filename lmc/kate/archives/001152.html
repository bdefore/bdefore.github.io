	<h3 class="title">Quarterly Report I</h3>
	<font color=#bb0000>November 03, 2003</font><br />
<p>In the past, I have allowed my own romantic ideals, derived primarily from art and literature, dictate my expectations when dreaming out a train window.  Of course, the machinations of my mind formed a London of Dickensian fog and umbrellas glistening against red brick like mirrors at midnight; a New York of Marvel-Comic architecture and spray paint, and a Paris of accordions and berets:  and, of course, reality stepped forth and upon disembarkation I took in the contemporary guild.  Although Greece is the ‘cradle of civilisation’ and all that, I had no expectations:  just some vague sense of the robes of Orthodoxy and the flood-lit acropolis keeping silent vigil over a new age of Greeks.  A new age of Greeks is exactly what I got: driving in yellow taxi-cabs and listening to Rembetika on walkmans, drinking coffee with the fine grounds still in the cup, and enjoying the Athens sun on the veranda in the afternoon.  </p>

<p>I arrived and had a week at a hostel nestled in the touristy streets of Plaka, and it was largely used as a hub for tourists stopping for a rest before skipping across the Aegean to spend the last days of summer ‘Island hopping’:  that is, touring the Cyclades for fun-in-the-sun, mai-tais on the beach, a tan without lines, electro-dancing deep into the night.  Summer in Athens is completely devoid of Greeks, and tourists come and go after a brief Indiana Jones stint at the Acropolis to see the cerulean sea and sky.   My sense of place and agenda was thrown off, especially since everyone I had arranged to meet was on holiday until September.  The hostel, though, infused me with the thrill of once again slipping into my traveling boots – getting my sea legs – and, sleeping in that low, wooden bed with its thin slip-sheet amongst the luggage of strangers, towels hanging to dry, and new restless wanderers nightly, I had time to think about my position in the world.  I came to the conclusion that there is no conclusion:  thus far on this trip, I’ve taken on roles as world-weary walker in the rain, as fine studious art-historian climbing the marble library steps, as late-night club-kid, as a studio artist armed with  fine pigments and camel-hair brushes.  So, even though there is a constant evolution, my sense of self is a collage with a harmonious use of material.  The project progress is invariably linked to my personal progress</p>

<p>One thing that has caused me many hours of contemplation and discussion is my position as a woman.  I was asked so many times before leaving the U.S. about my decision to enter what is primarily a ‘man’s world’:  that is, Byzantine painters, monks, and the like.  I can safely say (after growing up in the incredibly liberal community we fondly refer to as ‘Swirlington’ – (that is, Burlington, Vermont) and attending Sarah Lawrence college that I shrugged off the question with a (regrettably) pompous ‘I’ll figure something out’ or the ‘I can do whatever I set out to do’ mentality as a contemporary ‘strong-willed’ woman.  I thought that things would work themselves out.  What I found, though, is that every minute that I’m alone here I am reminded in one way or another that I am a female:  I had taken for granted in Vermont and at college my ability to be invisible if I felt like it.  I am reminded when I get a complimentary dish of watermelons after dinner, or an invitation to go for a midnight swim with the guy at the tourist-information office, or a hiss on the street.  Thankfully, though, the people who have become my advisors, mentors, and ‘colleagues’ have been nothing but absolutely warm and professional.  </p>

<p>The cast of characters on my journey so far have been beautiful.  It’s exactly like the Bob Dylan quote, ‘everybody will help you discover what you set out to find’.  Right before I left the country, though, I received word of the unexpected death (following a brief illness) of my correspondent and primary contact Professor David Turner.  It was shocking news, and sad, and devastating:  he was so warm in all of his e-mails, and we were mutually excited to work together.  I was at a loss here in this new country how to even begin to offer my condolences to Mr. Markos Kambanis, his colleague and my other contact.  I sent him a long e-mail, and he called me after some time to arrange our first meeting.  He invited me to his studio, and it was like hearing Beethoven’s 9th Symphony in a private recital hall before it was played for the public.  He had, in a word, everything I was searching for:  woodcuts of the towers of Mount Athos commissioned by the monks, books he had published full of miniatures of the lives of ascetics, and icons on wood.  He also had a down to earth and realistic attitude on painting in general, opinions of the ‘baroque’ use of gold and its implications, and stories of how he got started producing art that has been long ‘out of fashion’.  After a long tour of his studio and conversation, we ordered pizza and he introduced me to his young sons.  I left in high spirits with another meeting planned:  this time, with his good friend Mr. Babis Legas, who binds manuscripts in the traditional style.  Markos also lent me a stack of books on history and technique.  I met Babis the next week, who was an unassuming man smelling of old leather and glue.  He had a carmine cigarette holder and an ashtray that was a little pewter book whose cover opens and closes.  His shop was in a downtown ‘book arkade’:  a covered, narrow street with galleries of booksellers and makers, full of students and teachers leaning in over manuscripts with cups of coffee.  We talked about why he’s still doing what he’s doing:  binding books in editions of a hundred at most by hand when there is a plethora of modern methods.  My network of artists expanded even more through Babis:  he recommended an icon painter on the isle of Naxos.  We arranged a meeting with his daughter, Eri Korres, who was nice enough to translate.</p>

<p>The Naxos trip was amazing:  I hopped on a boat one afternoon, books and sketchbooks in tow.   I couldn’t believe my luck and the expansion of my root-system of people who were doing what I set out to find.  Mr. Emmanuel Korres met me with his daughter at seven the evening after I arrived, and over a walnut-honey cake made by his wife he told me secrets of the written word and the painted picture:  how the two are woven together like a Byzantine knot.  He has decided to learn how medieval miniatures are produced by using only the materials they would have had available then, including vellum that he stretches himself from goat-skin and binders and paint made from herbs and flowers.  He gave me examples to take home:  a poster from a recent exhibition, a book he copied completely by hand, small pieces of dyed and natural vellum, color copies of pages he illuminated, and photos of the process of making paper.  I left with his best wishes, a hundred handshakes, and both of us beaming.  He was incredulated and thrilled that a young American woman was pursuing the subject that he had devoted his life’s work to, and I was thrilled, in a word, at his life’s work!</p>

<p>Back in Athens  I’ve been going to the National Library from 9 until 2 where I have a pass and permission to handle old manuscripts from the ten and eleven hundreds.  So, there I sit in the special department under the auspices of the painted trompe-l’oeil marble ceiling with theology students and Orthodox priests furiously taking notes with one hand, holding my magnifying glass with the other.  </p>

<p>On a less formal note, the city of Athens and its inhabitants are so, so wonderful in so many ways.  It’s true that it’s strange to separate my work and play sometimes, as I mentioned before, so I just reconcile it as well-roundedness.  Along with painting small examples of miniatures, I’ve been working on my own illustrations, including a series of expressionistic images on paper using the same hand-ground pigment, old tea-bags and the words of the contemporary Greek poet George Seferis.  I’ve made some close friends (namely, my absolutely wonderful housemate, Dimitris, who amongst other things invited me to a traditional Greek wedding and the shower, called a ‘Bed’).  An evening out here starts with a 10 pm dinner and ends early in the morning:  the night-spots include typical bars, more traditional cafes with live music, and clubs.  I took two weekend romps to get out of the city for a while, and see the rest of Greece.  One was out to the mountains where I visited Delphi, trekked a bit, and hung out in the village of Lamia with some friends.  We stayed at a country house and I saw how olives grow, how you get them off the trees, and how beautiful and pastoral grapes are dripping from vines so big that they’ve become trees.  My other ‘vacation’ was to the Isle of Serifos which is a quiet little piece of rock on the Aegean where there was a wonderful amount of nothing to do:  just go to cafes for ouzo, hop on the white-washed rooftops, and get beach-sand between ones toes.</p>

<p>I write this with a few more weeks here in Athens, and then I think I’ll be ready to wash the ancient dust off my feet in the Black Sea (just kidding, it’ll be far too cold in Russia).  I will be sending an e-mail requesting two additional countries (Ireland and England) which hold imperative ‘connective tissue’ between early Christian manuscripts and the Buddhist sutras that I’ll be searching for in a few months.  There are specific books I would like to consult, and the ‘Scriptorium’ I had mentioned in my original proposal has moved from Russia to London!  I would just divide the four weeks of Russia to include the additional countries.  I’ll send the full proposal as soon as possible.   Until then, there are still more Byzantine pages to turn and more mousaka to eat!  Kali nichta.</p>
