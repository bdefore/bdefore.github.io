<p>1/14/04</p>

<p>The searing Athenian sun and blue skies gave way to a much more tranquil autumn that carried the scents of earth softened by Mediterranean rain. The dry dust and high midday sun turned to gentle clouds and all the women at the cafes began to wrap soft light wool scarves around their bronzed shoulders, shivering now over their bottles of ouzo. The transition from the long, hot days devoid of any kind of relief save for chewing on ice and hugging the fan and late-night dips in the salt, salt sea to wet Autumnal weather awoke all my Northern senses. The Norwegian gentleman, Abio, who sold me my powdered pigment woke up, too: we had long conversations about the dulling heat. Needless to say, my last month there was productive artistically: I spread newspapers on the floor and painted, my pigmented fingers leafing through Greek poetry and translations to incorporate into the ubiquitous ‘image’. And then, one morning I closed the cover of the manuscript I was working on at the National Library and closed, also, the Athenian chapter of my excursion. The change in the weather brought about changes in my sensibilities and I began to long for chimney-tops and stone row-houses and the tweed-clad academics of English universities. I bid all my farewells and up and went one morning with a one-way ticket to Manchester, England.</p>

<p>The return to my native language was blissful and strange simultaneously. In Greece, I became accustomed to assuming people spoke little or no English, as was the case even with some of the artists I was working with. Trying to ask for masking tape at an Athenian hardware store one afternoon took about a half an hour of sign-language and drawing…the cashier finally reached under the counter and triumphantly produced his own personal roll of tape. “For that effort,” he said, in broken English, “You can take the tape as a gift!” Interviewing painters about text and language (when language was something we didn’t share) took patience on both sides, and a certain receptiveness often absent during English conversation. Getting off the plane at the airport and following signs in Manchester was effortless: suddenly, x was x and p was p and there were no deltas or omegas to be found. Directions were clear and simple and delivered with emotionless efficiency. It felt like the first time I visited the optician and was fitted with a rather strong prescription after months of squinting and seeing the world with fuzzy auras around everything. Perception became not necessarily better, but definitely easier.</p>

<p>I settled into a house in Yorkshire with my own room and a family, and tried to adjust to all the drastic differences. My beloved olives and oil and farm-stand vegetables gave way to beans and tinned carrots and toast; my nights of café-going and ouzo sipping became quiet evenings wrapped around the fireplace with animal bestiaries in translation. Strangely, I even became jet-lagged though the time change was only one hour difference: in Greece people keep very, very unusual hours and on the Moors it’s up by seven and in bed by ten. I planned my first trip to Bodleian Library at Oxford university after a bureaucracy string of e-mails asking permission to read in their Duke Humfrey library. Even upon arrival, I had to spend a couple days having additional recommendations faxed as the Watson Fellowship falls into a gray area in their fine print about post-graduate institutions and students. I spent my application-processing time in the slide library with a wonderful woman by the name of Rigmor Batsvik, whose office looked out over the ivory towers. She excitedly handed me bestiaries including one containing lots of motifs of bells: gorgons and bells, devils and bells, you name it. “It’s quite a noisy manuscript, isn’t it?” she said to me, adjusting her wire rim frames and going on with her work.</p>

<p>Eventually, my original library pass was shredded and I was given a Class A reader card, laminated with my picture. It was the skeleton key into the shadowy perch above the Gothic turrets of Oxford, full of dust and quiet academics shuffling by in crinoline and tweed. I entered the library and was swallowed into another dimension where the only smell is old vellum and the sound is a symphony of turning eleventh-century pages with the accompaniment of rain on the window panes and the delicate harmonies of graphite scratchings on paper. In my proposal for the Watson, I had mentioned a story about a brief (but life-changing) pilgrimage to see the Book of Kells. Needless to say, the Duke Humfrey library soared above and beyond any expectations I could have day-dreamed. There were no glass cases, no ’museumization’, no tourists viewing the world through their camera (click, shoot and onto the next country!), no marble floors and stale air. Instead, it was a little old man with spectacles smiling at me and handing me precious books all wrapped up in cardboard and string, and small desks with soft lamps, and painted shields on the ceilings, and 11th century dust under my nails, and the evening sun setting beyond the courtyard leaving me in a midnight library so close to the ones my original scribes may have been originally conceiving the manuscripts in.</p>

<p>While in Oxford, I also had an interview with a monk by the name of Brother Aidan Hart of Shropshire, Shrewsbury near the Welsh border. Markos Kambanis, my very dear Greek artist friend passed his name onto me. Brother Aidan is an illustrator and iconographer. We discussed image and words, creating illustrations for God and the illiterate and for the lovers of life and art. He gave me gifts of prints and we’ve begun a correspondence. Markos and Brother Aidan are a part of a bridge that connects the ancient to the present: contemporary, down to earth people with ideas and sentiments shared by craftsmen of yore. The artists (and my own artistic enterprises) are really important to staying centered and grounded. I set off to find people who are still painting and illuminating, and my hunt has led to many, many more people on the academic side of things. I’ve always had some trepidation about untraditionally identifying as both an aspiring art historian as well as visual artist, but the two are slowly becoming naturally and simply reconciled as I travel forward. Soon, I’ll be at a Tibetan center in Dharamsala where most people are devoted to learning history as well as creating art without the Western academic pressure to do one or the other.</p>

<p>I write this quarterly report from the green shores of County Galway in Ireland where there’s been a step back from the formalities of fancy British libraries. People here are easy to talk to, and because Kells and Durrow are national treasures, it’s not unusual to have people in pubs glance up from their Guinness if I’ve mentioned my project and offer a word or a story. This was definitely not the case in Greece and England where ‘illuminated manuscript’ doesn’t mean a whole lot to everyone. Cheers to my rather obscure subject! It really just means that when I do find people who are interested, they’re pretty much devoted, and having dinner with them is triumphant. I’m working out the final details of my India visa next week (which is good for six months from the date of issue) and plan to hit the high Himalayan mountains by the first week in February.</p>

<p>So, I’m swiftly coming on to the end of the European half of my Watson adventure, and the Celtic Crosses of the insular gospels are going to be giving way to the Crosses in the center of the Buddhist Mandala. The eight comes round and round, sliding from the neck of a Durrow beast onward, and I’m continuing on my path excited to see what happens next as the pages continue to turn and turn beneath my feet. </p>
