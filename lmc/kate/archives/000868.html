<p><b>Further Illuminated:<br />
 The Buddhist and Christian illuminated manuscript tradition: <br />
Greece, Russia, India, Tibet</b></p>

<p><i>During our period at the abbey his hands were always covered with the dust of books, the gold of still-fresh illumination, or with yellowish substances he touched in Severinus&#8217;s infirmary.  He seemed unable to think save with his hands, an attribute I considered then worthier of a mechanic:  but even when his hands touched the most fragile things, such as freshly illuminated codices, or pages worn by time and friable as unleavened bread, he possessed, it seemed to me, an extraordinarily delicate touch&#8230;</i><br />
Umberto Eco, The Name of the Rose</p>

<p>The train ride was long and I had been delayed for an unusual amount of time at the baggage-hold in the station, as the world cup game was on that day and the old man at the register was sloshing his pint around back and largely ignoring me.  It had looked like rain earlier; the countryside had been a pale and pastoral hue of green, a heavy fog claiming most of my view.  Now, it was coming down in sheets chasing the fog into the gutters.  I ducked into a teahouse and managed a coffee-to-go with the change in my wallet and immediately found my way to the street that would take me to Dublin&#8217;s Trinity College Library.</p>

<p>	The campus was filled with milling students in wire-rim glasses carrying piles of books under their arms, or perhaps a briefcase or an unassuming black umbrella.  I wiped the rain off my face and looked around, overwhelmed by the English Oxford-type splendor of the place.  At least, it felt the way I would imagine Oxford to feel:  with the wet grass and expansive lawns, cobble stoned paths and haloed streetlights illuminating a watery afternoon.  I entered the library through a stone courtyard and turned to shake my umbrella on the steps.  Once inside, I blinked thrice like some sort of newborn kitten taking his first look at the world, or maybe like a medieval clergyman entering Notre Dame de Chartres for the first time.  My eyes shot immediately upward as in a cathedral of paint, prophesy, and plaster.  Every book was bound in old, cracking leather, many with gilded titles and letters.  Claudius Gilbert&#8217;s commissioned busts stood like beacons in front of each set of shelves.  Each aisle seemed so incredibly full of infinite learning and possibility, and the titles themselves were emanating magic, from Sacræ Theologiæ to Vicepræpos and beyond, written in some sort of ethereal font.  Each shelf under each title is assigned one letter of the Roman alphabet.  I wanted to mount the ladder propped to the second level and hide amongst the shelves reading the old books until I became as old and thin as the paper itself, whence I would take off my glasses and close my tired eyes in bliss having had seen the world in tones of crumbling ochre.</p>

<p>	I had just spent the year studying through the Wells College Program for the Arts in Paris, France.  It was my first real travel experience.  It was also my third year at college, the premier two having had been spent at Sarah Lawrence College.  In my Paris application for the Wells Program, I wrote about my dreams as a child where I derived travels to exotic lands through classic literature.  My favorite genre was probably fantasy:  the middle ages were indeed where I would have rather been (as opposed to Essex Junction, Vermont) but I went down the street to the Free Library every single afternoon and read most of what I could get my hands on.  The librarians assumed, I later discovered, that my mother was a teacher taking out books for her class.</p>

<p>	Paris was a time of reflection and change.  Each street that sprang alive with smells of urine mixed with coffee and crêpes, each cobblestone, each bum at Oberkampf near the textile stores seemed to resonate with an intense history.  The heaviness of the air in Gothic cathedrals seemed to me an intoxicating elixir.  Obviously, my first two years of college were a very social time, and since I was living at the Cité Universitaire in the Quatorzième Arrondissement with students from all over the universe, Paris was sometimes social as well.  However, I derived the deepest pleasure from my Gothic Art and Architecture course where we traveled to Romanesque, High Gothic, and Flamboyant Cathedrals positioned all over France.  Each time my head shot up towards the firmament that the architects were building ever-towards...I felt incredible chills.  Feeling the frisson...the divine shiver...of a time gone by was certainly different from just looking at slides and textbook illustrations.  </p>

<p>Second semester was less challenging, and since my class was spent, I ended up doing an independent study.  It started out as a personal joke between my professor and I, discussed mainly on trains and sometimes after a few glasses of Bordeaux at a dinner at her house.  We thought it would be wildly entertaining (and medieval) to articulate some of the stranger sculptural programs depicted in stone.  Later, after a trip to the Musée National du Moyen Âge and a look at their books of hours (which visitors can actually leaf through) I decided to do a puppet show articulating the Labours of the Months as a sort of celestial Pageant.  I did some research about the texts themselves, but the project was mainly visual art and performance based.  Once again, I really found that I had a love for the manuscripts.  Flipping through them after having ducked into Cluny from the chaotic streets of the Latin Quarter was a solace and refuge.</p>

<p>	I also copied a painting at the Louvre, using the techniques of the Dutch masters.  I ground pigment, oiled the wood panel, used an ancient gesso formula.  The first part of the class (prior to being allotted an easel) we tried all different techniques using home-mixed materials ground on slabs of marble.  When we did egg-tempera, I copied icons from a Byzantine tapestry.  This experience led me to think about a career potentially focusing in the art and chemistry of restoration; or getting a doctorate in Art History in order to do fieldwork in the area of ancient art. I began to wonder about ancient illuminated manuscript preservation, and the contemporary artists (and monks) who continue to keep alive this art form.  The painting class was in some ways a more structured continuation of an independent &#8216;conference&#8217; project during my first year at Sarah Lawrence where I produced a few small fresco panels using the original cartoons of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Leonardo DaVinci.  Of course, that was just one of the many independent projects I&#8217;ve undertaken at Sarah Lawrence College; most have been papers drawing in depth parallels between disparate aspects of art, religion, and history.  I have also had the opportunity to intern with the Senior Registrar at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and to conduct research in the art history archives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

<p>	Further back, in High School, I identified as a &#8216;writer&#8217; and joined the Literary Forum.  I also started to produce art and found that I had a particular knack for making children&#8217;s books, first writing poems inspired by Aesop, Dylan Thomas, and maybe Natalie Babbitt and turning them into pictorial watercolor dreamscapes.  I became involved with a group of artists, writers, and professors in Burlington called the Aesthesians.  They loved all things beautiful (like true Victorian aesthetes) and appreciated the craftsmanship of objects produced in a time long gone by, such as a pieced together authentic Tiffany lamp or a heavy Victorian candlestick.  They would read from the most beautiful first editions, with gold leaf and pressed leather.  My favorite may have been a miniature copy of Wilde&#8217;s Salome, which was eventually given to me as a gift.  This is where I first developed my affinity for well-made books.</p>

<p>	I&#8217;ve always believed in some ways that Burlington, Vermont is a somewhat magical place in the sense that it allows for interesting travel and learning experiences within its borders.  I suppose it has to do mainly with three factors:  it&#8217;s a university town (housing the University of Vermont, St. Michael&#8217;s College, and Burlington College campuses), there&#8217;s a major flourishing art scene bringing in people from the world over, and there&#8217;s a coffee-shop culture that allows for the kind of random discussion that one finds in the novels of Andre Breton and Henri Lefebvre.  Burlington is its own autonomous pocket of culture; I walked through the streets and met wide arrays of travelers and students.  It was a way for me to travel at a time when I was lacking the money and means to actually hop on a plane and go abroad.  My interest in Buddhism was sparked when I met a group of Tibetan refugees who hardly spoke English but would press their hands against mine and say, &#8220;A Lotus for you and a Buddha to be&#8221;.   Monks also occasionally filter from the Green Mountain Shambhala centers and retreats in the North for conferences on the St. Michael&#8217;s lawn.  There are frequently Edmondite priests and shaven Buddhists having lunch and preparing for seminars.  After my third year of high school, perhaps inspired by the religious richness of my community, I enrolled in a summer program for accelerated students at Skidmore College and studied Theology and Writing.  The survey course focusing on Eastern religions clarified some of my independent reading and thoughts on the Bhagavad-Gita as well as certain Buddhist Sutras.  </p>

<p>	I recalled all of this in Paris when I saw a street exhibit on the people of the Himalayas, and I noticed how similar their manuscripts were to the medieval ones that I had been focusing on.  The Watson project I&#8217;m proposing appeals to my longstanding interest in books, my recent interest in using ancient techniques to produce art, my art historical background and knowledge of Christian and Buddhist iconographies.  While I was at the aforementioned Trinity College Library in Dublin while backpacking after my year in Paris, I looked upon the Book of Kells.  In the ancient Celtic text, the knot patterns look not unlike a Buddhist knot of eternity.  However, the similarities throughout the pages, like the knot, do not begin nor end with this great book.  They reach much further back across borders and time, and through yellowing pages.  </p>

<p>These similarities excited me so much that as soon as I returned to my home in Vermont, I sent out a mass e-mail to the some of the faculty at St. Michael&#8217;s college wondering if anyone had any expertise in these areas.  I got two enthusiastic responses:  one was from Dean Edward Mahoney of the Theology department and the other was from Joanne Schneider who is the Director of Library and Information services.   I immediately made appointments.  Dean Mahoney, an expert on the ancient icons that may have inspired the Book of Kells, directed me to Russia and Greece while Joanne Schneider, a Buddhist xylograph expert and collector had actually worked at the library in Dharamsala.  Independently, I gave myself a crash course on the Byzantine iconoclastic controversies, the origins of Buddhist art, the craft of manuscript-making, and, thanks to Thich Nhat Hanh and his book Living Buddha, Living Christ a jump-start into how source documents in the two religions are not so different than they might initially seem.</p>

<p>Little did I realize during my experience studying art history before traveling to Paris that the people and context of the art plays such a huge role in really understanding it.  Some people are concerned with saving entire cultures or complete rainforests.  To me, the venerated manuscripts that I&#8217;m focusing my attention on function as small microcosms:  I can learn about ancient culture, contemporary culture, love, beauty, history, and religion through such seemingly small objects.  There are many levels to the books themselves:  they contain stories, they may have been created as an act of veneration, they exists as objects, they are much respected, and they hold within them religious secrets.  I am in love with ancient art; I want to devote my entire life to living abroad and discovering the enigmas of ancient human stories and religion using art as a catalyst.  Right now, I&#8217;m focusing on why in this age of digital books and computers people still press vellum and bind books, filling the pages with religious script and images.  I want to learn these techniques that could be dying, and meet artists that still care about embellishing their religious stories with hauntingly beautiful, enigmatic pictures and gold leaf.  	<br />
