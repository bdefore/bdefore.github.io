<h3 class="title">Happy Halloween</h3>

<p>	I know this may seem a bit belated; however it is time for yet another update.  And as always, there's pics at community.webshots.com/user/kenbonneville take care</p>

<p>	Exactly two weeks before Halloween I was caught in one of those corners that every Peace Corps volunteer eventually sees: the inevitable comparison between yourself and past volunteers, whose shoes you are now trying to fill.<br />
	So, two weeks before Halloween I was in class with my 11th graders.  My last class for the week, and tomorrow I was to be in Vatra Dornei visiting a friend and buying a winter coat.  While talking with my students a question gets raised: <br />
	&#8220;Can we have a Halloween party here?  When Jason was here he threw a Halloween party.&#8221;<br />
	Jason!  Grr&#8230;there&#8217;s that name again.  I, myself, have never met the man.  And for that matter neither have my students.  Jason is the only other volunteer to have been at my sight in the past, and he left four years ago.  I have nothing really against the man, but I do get to walk into school every day beneath a picture of his smiling face.  So I reply to this student, who has now cornered me:<br />
	&#8220;Yeah, of course we can; but, how did you know about Jason throwing a Halloween party?  You weren&#8217;t in school here yet.&#8221;<br />
	&#8220;My cousin told me about it.&#8221;  She replies.<br />
Old cousins.  Damn, I forgot about their influence in small towns.  <br />
	I make a deal with them that I&#8217;ll think about it over the weekend, but that it should be a possibility as long they&#8217;re willing to help make some arrangements.  There&#8217;s a resounding yes from them, and it seems like everything is set.  <br />
	Saturday I become ill.<br />
	Sunday I feel worse.  <br />
	And Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is a slow recovery.<br />
	On top of this slight viral distraction I don&#8217;t here anything from my students in the 11th grade who were so adamant about helping me get this party organized.  Not until I mention to them at some point during this week that I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll be a possibility.  They wine and complain, but don&#8217;t really do anything to start trying to change the course of events.  <br />
	I tell some of them to meet Andrei and I after school if they&#8217;re interested in helping set up and plan the party.  There&#8217;s a resounding &#8220;yes&#8221; from many of them swearing they&#8217;ll be there.  <br />
	I may have had a resounding &#8220;yes&#8221; in class, but I also got resoundly ditched by after school that day. <br />
	That&#8217;s it!  I declare to Andrei there&#8217;s no hope in us putting this party on.  <br />
	The day we got ditched was the Tuesday before Halloween, and the next day my 11th graders have class with Andrei first thing in the morning.  The next hour I find three of them marching into my room profusely apologizing for ditching me, and promising to get everything set up.  <br />
	Bygones be bygones.  The party is underway, with two days now until we need to have everything ready.  No time crunch.  I promise.  <br />
	The day before the party the money is raised for food and decorations, and I promise to go shopping with three students for the prizes for the best costume after school.   Tomorrow is the big day.  <br />
	Andrei and I make arrangements to use the school&#8217;s gym and speaker system with the principle.  Plans are made to make a Piñata, give out prizes for the best costume and otherwise just play music and let the students dance as much as they want.  We provide food, drinks and hopefully a good time for all.  On top of this students are charged 5,000 Lei to enter with a costume and 10,000 Lei to enter without a costume &#8211; this translates to about .25 cents with a costume and .29 cents without a costume.  <br />
	On Friday I enter school at 7AM, and teach my three classes &#8211; I&#8217;m done at 11AM that day.  The last of these three classes is with the same class that two weeks earlier began this whole process.  We essentially just talk about everything that we have, what we might still need, and see who&#8217;s staying after school today to decorate the gym.  <br />
The entire class is staying after school.  <br />
Class is over, and it&#8217;s time to start getting ready for the party.  <br />
Snag 1: Andrei was able to acquire use of the keys to the room with the speakers; however, the lock doesn&#8217;t want to turn now.  We eventually ask a construction work outside to come in and break the lock off for us.  With hammer and chisel he is hard pressed and failing and breaking the lock for us.  Without speakers we have no music.  Without music the students are unhappy.  If the students are unhappy I get a bad rep.  <br />
Solution 1: When in dire straits always stop, take a break, breathe, and get a bigger hammer.  The lock is off, and the speakers are ours.  Lady&#8217;s and gentleman; we have the ability to play music.  <br />
Snag 2: The ability to play music does not give us music to play.  Catalin, a 12th grade student of mine, was planning on being the DJ; however, he needs time to run home and get his computer and stuff.  And he apparently lives a far ways from school.  <br />
Solution 2: When in a position of power take full advantage of it.  For example, me being a teacher allows me the power of excusing Catalin from school in order to run home and grab Catalin&#8217;s computer; anything in the name of extracurricular activities.   <br />
Snag 3: At 5 o&#8217;clock there appears forty elementary school students in the gym.  They&#8217;re accompanied by a teacher claiming they have ballet practice here every week at this time and end at around 6:30.  <br />
Solution 3: Claim ignorance, and tell them they can stay until 6 o&#8217;clock because that&#8217;s when we have our party started.  This isn&#8217;t lying, however, because in this instance we actually are ignorant.  No one ever told us there&#8217;d be a mob of eight-year-olds practicing ballet in our gym the final hour we have to finish setting up things.  <br />
Snag 4: It&#8217;s been years since I&#8217;ve made a piñata, and I really had forgotten at how long it takes for one of these things to dry.  In fact it didn&#8217;t dry until the next day.<br />
Solution 4: &#8220;What piñata?&#8221;  Pretend it never existed, and just go on with everything else as planned.  </p>

<p>These are all the problems that occurred during the course of the night, and they were fairly well manageable.  We had planned to end the night around 9 o&#8217;clock because many of the students wanted to move on to another Disco in town at that point.  So when the lights are turned on there is a rush to clean, and scatter.  <br />
All in all it was a great success.  My costume, in case you&#8217;re wondering at this point was &#8211; don&#8217;t laugh &#8211; being a grunge person from Seattle.  I think I pulled it off rather well too, despite my lack of long hair these last 4 years. <br />
The night was over and Andrei, his girlfriend Andrea, Tom, four of my students and myself all head to the bar to sit and finally relax.  Basking in our self-confidence over pulling off a Halloween party in two days&#8217; time.  <br />
Upon returning to school we have discovered that this little party was such a great success that the students, and some of the staff, want us to organize another one this semester.  However, the Christmas plans are already getting underway.  The piñata is sitting in my classroom; ready and waiting for the inevitable blows to its image.  <br />

<p>Very nice Ken.  Maybe we should have the Peace Corps move you to the position of "Official Party Planner".  There could be some definite benefits in that.<br />
I think you should take Buck's advice for next year and get a bunch of pyrotechnics.  My personal suggestion is to go as Gene Simmons.  Or maybe you could get some teachers together and all go collectively as Kiss?</p>

<p>There is my two cents.  Have a good one,</p>

<p>Jason</p>

<p><br />
P.S. - On a random and odd side note I went as a rock star for halloween and my costume was often mistook for grunge attire.<br />

<p>Hey Ken,<br />
Very entertaining. You've obviously taken your government-sponsored position to your head there, cutting through red tape as though with a chainsaw from Fargo. Yes, I know you're not a "Dakohtan" but close enough you polar bear you.</p>

<p>I can't wait till next year when you have to live up to this year's legacy again. You'll have to dress up as Pink from The Wall and sponsor all kinds of pyrotechnics to make the parents think Chernobyl's percolating again.</p>

<p>It sounds like you should be planning for a Valentine's Day party...</p>

<p>Are any of your kids into stamp collecting? Do any want to exchange Romanian for USA stamps?</p>
