<h3 class="title">For the next two years I will be staying in...</h3>

<p>Campulung Moldovensc!!!  I think I'm excited by this, but to be honest I'm not really sure.  In fact, we (current Peace Corps trainees) still know so little about Romania all we are able to do is look at the location of the country we are going to, and guess on the size.  Overal, we think we're happy but we're not sure.<br />
What I do know about the site thanks to what I have already been given today is that the county I'm staying in is 52% forrest, a large portion of which is national parkland too.  This is all in comparison to 7% of Romania being covered by forrests, to put it all in some perspective for you.  Campulung Moldovensc is also in the Norheast region of Romania...an area called Bucovina, which is known for its naturual beauty in both scenery and its painted monastaries.<br />
Further cause for excitment is that it looks like I'm going to a rather wild portion of Romania, where popular activities include, hunting, camping, fishing...and it looks as if there are many bears and other wild animals throughout the area.  (so for those of you who know me, that means more Ken sneaking up on bears stories, like those I came out of yellowstone with ;) ).  <br />
So far it appears that I'm teaching at a National College of Romania.  This is actually a high school, but it appears to be a language intensive high school...the student population is 570, and of that amount there are 543 that are learning both french and english.  This means I"m getting what I want, I think, and will be teaching content courses for the next two years.  <br />
If anyone is interested on where I'm going I found this website online that's in Romania, but does offer some pictures of the region on it: http://www.campulung-moldovenesc.ro/<br />
Anyway, next weekend I visit this site...and this weekend is a visit to Brasov and Bran castle.  Bran is what is fabled to be Vlad Dracul's castle...however it isn't.  The reason it has become known as the famed castle seems thanks to Bram Stoker, who described this castle as being Dracula's.  <br />
Take care, and keep writing, there are slowly some postcards getting into the mail right now, which means give them a couple weeks I guess.  <br />
Also this means I'm leaving Ploesti soon, so maybe stop writing the current address, and I'll give you my new one soon.  <br />

<p>Okay Ken "we think we're happy but we're not sure"?  I knew you were an indecisive lad, but really.  :P  I find it quite amusing that you’re closer to a connection with the outside world while in some little place in Romania then I am in the US—it may take you a ½ hour to walk to an internet café but it takes me 45 minutes to DRIVE to the nearest real phone with an internet connection.  So no complaining.  *sigh* I just sit by the mailbox waiting day after day for the pony express to bring a letter from you up the mountain...waiting and waiting...hehe.  Anyway, glad to hear you’re in a beautiful spot.  Makes it more likely that I’ll come visit you.  Just don’t get eaten by some wild creature, kay?  Unless you snap a lot of pictures as it comes rushing at you and then fling the camera gently away at the last moment so at least we get a cool photo series of the animal attack out of the deal.  You are taking lots of pictures, right?  Much love, Emily</p>

<p>Looks great, Ken! America's definitely putting you on the edge. I attest to the statement above: can't read a damn thing, but it looks perty.</p>

<p>I just like the name :) campulung-mulsomethingsomething. It's very good indeed. And the school sounds like it'll be a blast (and easy since they already probably speak excellent english). I'm super excited for you and I hope you end up in one of those beautiful places. </p>

<p>Ken,<br />
I checked out the webpage and, putting aside my inability to read a single word, your new home looks beautiful.  If nothing else you seem to have wonderful scenery to look forward to.  I think you will fit it perfectly.  Congratulations!<br />
your groupie,<br />
Katie</p>

<p>FYI: still no decision - I'll know by Wednesday :)</p>
