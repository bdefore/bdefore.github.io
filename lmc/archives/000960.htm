<p>The feeling has finally set in. While my Spanish progress owes a lot to the two weeks of language instruction at Downtown LC, I'm anxious to depart west, for an experience that does not have the contrivations of urban life. I contemplate this jump with as much care as excitement. It is, without a doubt, my deepest dive into international "travel." It's time to put my language skills to the test.</p>

<p>The future holds a better test, but for yesterday's I went to see the movie Intentidad (Identity). This is my first cinema experience in a country of a different primary language than English. I was surprised at how expensive it was. At 10 pesos, it's a significant dent on the income of the average Argentino, yet the theatre was absolutely packed with people, probably of a capacity of 300-400 people. I doubt that Americans would so dutifully flock to a movie that was only subtitled for them. I really enjoy the priviledge of having the Spanish subtitles as well as the English audio. I've managed to learn a dozen new Spanish words just from one movie. As a sidenote, it's a fantastic movie. Everything that's good from both Memento and Seven, put together into one.</p>

<p>But, returning to the idea of a test in language skills... Language skills?! What language skills?</p>

<p>This one's for you BT: despite the nature of it all, traveling does not turn anyone into a fountain of poetry. There are too many levels where thoughts must be refined into the simplest of possible words, sometimes escorted with animated gestures. Diet Coke language. Spoken to those to whom English is a second, third, or... not... a tool in the chest. As a result, savvy polysyllabic words of college are put on dry dock. Words such as: therefore, significant, simplified, ergo, thesis, multifaceted, generalization, globalization, anywordendingin-tion, pelican, exacorbate, indigenous, et. al. ... Phew! I probably should have taken the GRE before the Watson. All you college students out there, please! comment to this entry and give me some words only heard on college campus. They're flying out of my head muy rapido.</p>

<p>While this is going on, I am learning a new language as well. Imagine if your fundamental kindergarten concepts of language are a luxury that must be jettisoned in order to start over again at age 23. What with having to rebuild, and often reverse, my intuition for where pronouns go and how verbs change and even the concept of what good grammar is...</p>

<p>OK, this might not the best time for a test. Heh. Of course it is.</p>

<p>On a hint from one of the local professoras of Spanish here, I'm researching the possibility of visiting Capilla del Monte, in the southern part of Cordoba Province. Apparently there are some interesting legends of alien visitation there. This is most certainly not lake monster research, but it is tangential (the subject of legendry and the impact on the community) and at least it is relatively close - a quick flight from Buenos Aires should get me there. I'll talk with Florencia tomorrow to plot out finer details.</p>

<p>P.S. I've also managed to speak a little better language with Miss Tungsten here, the tool that brings you the journal entries. We've been cooperating better lately. Yes, I've finally discovered it's a female. Not just a female, but a pregnant one, pregnant with information and therefore must be catered to every now and then and given lots of ice cream ... I mean... properly voltage buffered electricity... Ok so it's not like a pregnant lady. Have I ever made sense?</p>

<p>P.P.S... Jim you will especially appreciate this. I've met a Leicester bloke named Richard Bowles (with an accent that pronounces it "Bawls") Double this with the fact that he has black glasses more-than-somewhat resembles Austin Powers in looks and mannerisms. Has better teeth. An Israeli was joking with him about it and he laughed and responded, "You'll be eating hospital food if you carry on like that." Sarci by nature.</p>

<p>P.P.P.S. Stick a fork in me. I'm done.</p><a name="more"></a><div class="blog"><div id="menu"><a href="../archives/000958.htm">&laquo; Sunset On the Strait of Georgia</a> || <a href="../archives/000961.htm">Reference Point &raquo;</a><br /></div></div></div></div><div class="journal_entriesbottom"></div><div id="comments"><div class="comments-head"><a name="comments"></a>Comments</div><div class="comments-body"><p>Hegemony, utilization, correlate, causation, hypothesis, socialization, specialization, undernourished, environmental, disenfrancisement, implementation, sensitization (add a 'de' to it as well), di- and mono- zygotic, experimentation, postulization, enuciation, gesticulate, efficacy... and of course, the most important one: procreation.</p>
