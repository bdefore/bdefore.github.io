<span class="description">Welcome to the website of a wanderjahr: a yearlong disciplined whimsy of Buck DeFore. Sponsored by the Watson Fellowship, I will be traveling to six sites around the world in search of the many nuances of lake-monster-culture. In particular, I will focus on implications upon tourism, identity, and the role of mythology. Within you will find journal entries, photographs, and perhaps something unexpected.</span>
