<p><b>Further Illuminated:<br />
 The Buddhist and Christian illuminated manuscript tradition: <br />
Greece, Russia, India, Tibet</b></p>

<p><i>During our period at the abbey his hands were always covered with the dust of books, the gold of still-fresh illumination, or with yellowish substances he touched in Severinus&#8217;s infirmary.  He seemed unable to think save with his hands, an attribute I considered then worthier of a mechanic:  but even when his hands touched the most fragile things, such as freshly illuminated codices, or pages worn by time and friable as unleavened bread, he possessed, it seemed to me, an extraordinarily delicate touch&#8230;</i><br />
Umberto Eco, The Name of the Rose</p>

<p>The train ride was long and I had been delayed for an unusual amount of time at the baggage-hold in the station, as the world cup game was on that day and the old man at the register was sloshing his pint around back and largely ignoring me.  It had looked like rain earlier; the countryside had been a pale and pastoral hue of green, a heavy fog claiming most of my view.  Now, it was coming down in sheets chasing the fog into the gutters.  I ducked into a teahouse and managed a coffee-to-go with the change in my wallet and immediately found my way to the street that would take me to Dublin&#8217;s Trinity College Library.</p>

<p>	The campus was filled with milling students in wire-rim glasses carrying piles of books under their arms, or perhaps a briefcase or an unassuming black umbrella.  I wiped the rain off my face and looked around, overwhelmed by the English Oxford-type splendor of the place.  At least, it felt the way I would imagine Oxford to feel:  with the wet grass and expansive lawns, cobble stoned paths and haloed streetlights illuminating a watery afternoon.  I entered the library through a stone courtyard and turned to shake my umbrella on the steps.  Once inside, I blinked thrice like some sort of newborn kitten taking his first look at the world, or maybe like a medieval clergyman entering Notre Dame de Chartres for the first time.  My eyes shot immediately upward as in a cathedral of paint, prophesy, and plaster.  Every book was bound in old, cracking leather, many with gilded titles and letters.  Claudius Gilbert&#8217;s commissioned busts stood like beacons in front of each set of shelves.  Each aisle seemed so incredibly full of infinite learning and possibility, and the titles themselves were emanating magic, from Sacræ Theologiæ to Vicepræpos and beyond, written in some sort of ethereal font.  Each shelf under each title is assigned one letter of the Roman alphabet.  I wanted to mount the ladder propped to the second level and hide amongst the shelves reading the old books until I became as old and thin as the paper itself, whence I would take off my glasses and close my tired eyes in bliss having had seen the world in tones of crumbling ochre.</p>

<p>	I had just spent the year studying through the Wells College Program for the Arts in Paris, France.  It was my first real travel experience.  It was also my third year at college, the premier two having had been spent at Sarah Lawrence College.  In my Paris application for the Wells Program, I wrote about my dreams as a child where I derived travels to exotic lands through classic literature.  My favorite genre was probably fantasy:  the middle ages were indeed where I would have rather been (as opposed to Essex Junction, Vermont) but I went down the street to the Free Library every single afternoon and read most of what I could get my hands on.  The librarians assumed, I later discovered, that my mother was a teacher taking out books for her class.</p>

<p>	Paris was a time of reflection and change.  Each street that sprang alive with smells of urine mixed with coffee and crêpes, each cobblestone, each bum at Oberkampf near the textile stores seemed to resonate with an intense history.  The heaviness of the air in Gothic cathedrals seemed to me an intoxicating elixir.  Obviously, my first two years of college were a very social time, and since I was living at the Cité Universitaire in the Quatorzième Arrondissement with students from all over the universe, Paris was sometimes social as well.  However, I derived the deepest pleasure from my Gothic Art and Architecture course where we traveled to Romanesque, High Gothic, and Flamboyant Cathedrals positioned all over France.  Each time my head shot up towards the firmament that the architects were building ever-towards...I felt incredible chills.  Feeling the frisson...the divine shiver...of a time gone by was certainly different from just looking at slides and textbook illustrations.  <br />
Second semester was less challenging, and since my class was spent, I ended up doing an independent study.  It started out as a personal joke between my professor and I, discussed mainly on trains and sometimes after a few glasses of Bordeaux at a dinner at her house.  We thought it would be wildly entertaining (and medieval) to articulate some of the stranger sculptural programs depicted in stone.  Later, after a trip to the Musée National du Moyen Âge and a look at their books of hours (which visitors can actually leaf through) I decided to do a puppet show articulating the Labours of the Months as a sort of celestial Pageant.  I did some research about the texts themselves, but the project was mainly visual art and performance based.  Once again, I really found that I had a love for the manuscripts.  Flipping through them after having ducked into Cluny from the chaotic streets of the Latin Quarter was a solace and refuge.</p>

<p>	I also copied a painting at the Louvre, using the techniques of the Dutch masters.  I ground pigment, oiled the wood panel, used an ancient gesso formula.  The first part of the class (prior to being allotted an easel) we tried all different techniques using home-mixed materials ground on slabs of marble.  When we did egg-tempera, I copied icons from a Byzantine tapestry.  This experience led me to think about a career potentially focusing in the art and chemistry of restoration; or getting a doctorate in Art History in order to do fieldwork in the area of ancient art. I began to wonder about ancient illuminated manuscript preservation, and the contemporary artists (and monks) who continue to keep alive this art form.  The painting class was in some ways a more structured continuation of an independent &#8216;conference&#8217; project during my first year at Sarah Lawrence where I produced a few small fresco panels using the original cartoons of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Leonardo DaVinci.  Of course, that was just one of the many independent projects I&#8217;ve undertaken at Sarah Lawrence College; most have been papers drawing in depth parallels between disparate aspects of art, religion, and history.  I have also had the opportunity to intern with the Senior Registrar at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and to conduct research in the art history archives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

<p>	Further back, in High School, I identified as a &#8216;writer&#8217; and joined the Literary Forum.  I also started to produce art and found that I had a particular knack for making children&#8217;s books, first writing poems inspired by Aesop, Dylan Thomas, and maybe Natalie Babbitt and turning them into pictorial watercolor dreamscapes.  I became involved with a group of artists, writers, and professors in Burlington called the Aesthesians.  They loved all things beautiful (like true Victorian aesthetes) and appreciated the craftsmanship of objects produced in a time long gone by, such as a pieced together authentic Tiffany lamp or a heavy Victorian candlestick.  They would read from the most beautiful first editions, with gold leaf and pressed leather.  My favorite may have been a miniature copy of Wilde&#8217;s Salome, which was eventually given to me as a gift.  This is where I first developed my affinity for well-made books.</p>

<p>	I&#8217;ve always believed in some ways that Burlington, Vermont is a somewhat magical place in the sense that it allows for interesting travel and learning experiences within its borders.  I suppose it has to do mainly with three factors:  it&#8217;s a university town (housing the University of Vermont, St. Michael&#8217;s College, and Burlington College campuses), there&#8217;s a major flourishing art scene bringing in people from the world over, and there&#8217;s a coffee-shop culture that allows for the kind of random discussion that one finds in the novels of Andre Breton and Henri Lefebvre.  Burlington is its own autonomous pocket of culture; I walked through the streets and met wide arrays of travelers and students.  It was a way for me to travel at a time when I was lacking the money and means to actually hop on a plane and go abroad.  My interest in Buddhism was sparked when I met a group of Tibetan refugees who hardly spoke English but would press their hands against mine and say, &#8220;A Lotus for you and a Buddha to be&#8221;.   Monks also occasionally filter from the Green Mountain Shambhala centers and retreats in the North for conferences on the St. Michael&#8217;s lawn.  There are frequently Edmondite priests and shaven Buddhists having lunch and preparing for seminars.  After my third year of high school, perhaps inspired by the religious richness of my community, I enrolled in a summer program for accelerated students at Skidmore College and studied Theology and Writing.  The survey course focusing on Eastern religions clarified some of my independent reading and thoughts on the Bhagavad-Gita as well as certain Buddhist Sutras.  </p>

<p>	I recalled all of this in Paris when I saw a street exhibit on the people of the Himalayas, and I noticed how similar their manuscripts were to the medieval ones that I had been focusing on.  The Watson project I&#8217;m proposing appeals to my longstanding interest in books, my recent interest in using ancient techniques to produce art, my art historical background and knowledge of Christian and Buddhist iconographies.  While I was at the aforementioned Trinity College Library in Dublin while backpacking after my year in Paris, I looked upon the Book of Kells.  In the ancient Celtic text, the knot patterns look not unlike a Buddhist knot of eternity.  However, the similarities throughout the pages, like the knot, do not begin nor end with this great book.  They reach much further back across borders and time, and through yellowing pages.  </p>

<p>These similarities excited me so much that as soon as I returned to my home in Vermont, I sent out a mass e-mail to the some of the faculty at St. Michael&#8217;s college wondering if anyone had any expertise in these areas.  I got two enthusiastic responses:  one was from Dean Edward Mahoney of the Theology department and the other was from Joanne Schneider who is the Director of Library and Information services.   I immediately made appointments.  Dean Mahoney, an expert on the ancient icons that may have inspired the Book of Kells, directed me to Russia and Greece while Joanne Schneider, a Buddhist xylograph expert and collector had actually worked at the library in Dharamsala.  Independently, I gave myself a crash course on the Byzantine iconoclastic controversies, the origins of Buddhist art, the craft of manuscript-making, and, thanks to Thich Nhat Hanh and his book Living Buddha, Living Christ a jump-start into how source documents in the two religions are not so different than they might initially seem.</p>

<p>Little did I realize during my experience studying art history before traveling to Paris that the people and context of the art plays such a huge role in really understanding it.  Some people are concerned with saving entire cultures or complete rainforests.  To me, the venerated manuscripts that I&#8217;m focusing my attention on function as small microcosms:  I can learn about ancient culture, contemporary culture, love, beauty, history, and religion through such seemingly small objects.  There are many levels to the books themselves:  they contain stories, they may have been created as an act of veneration, they exists as objects, they are much respected, and they hold within them religious secrets.  I am in love with ancient art; I want to devote my entire life to living abroad and discovering the enigmas of ancient human stories and religion using art as a catalyst.  Right now, I&#8217;m focusing on why in this age of digital books and computers people still press vellum and bind books, filling the pages with religious script and images.  I want to learn these techniques that could be dying, and meet artists that still care about embellishing their religious stories with hauntingly beautiful, enigmatic pictures and gold leaf.  	<br />

<h3 class="title">I.</h3>

<p><b>Further Illuminated:<br />
 The Buddhist and Christian illuminated manuscript tradition: <br />
Greece, Russia, India, Tibet</b></p>

<p>I propose a year abroad devoted to the study (including learning the production techniques) of illuminated manuscripts of the Christian and Buddhist traditions in Greece, Russia, India, and Tibet.  Specifically, the project will be divided into two parts.  The first is a juxtaposed look at the function of iconography and illumination in early Christian and Buddhist manuscripts, for both readers and writers.  For the second part, I will learn the preservation of both the texts and the ancient techniques employed.  Going abroad through the Thomas J. Watson Foundation will facilitate dialogue between myself and the monks, artists, and scholars native to the countries I propose to visit who are also dedicated to this area of scholarship:  particularly, preserving this ancient tradition from extinction.</p>

<p>Books exist as a portable chamber of thoughts, ideas, stories, and images.  As objects, they can be aesthetic or not, crumpled or mass-produced in the form of a paperback.  It is no wonder that holy words from any number of faiths are transcribed between gilded covers, or in the form of neatly-wrapped scrolls looking like an edible pastry, or in miniature form with a brush so small it looks as if the human hand of the scribe must have been pushed with some sort of other-worldly force.  It is also no wonder that to further represent the sublime religious symbols and stories, people began pressing pages with gold, thus illuminating the books and bringing both writer and reader closer to understanding the mysteries contained before them. </p>

<p>Manuscript copying, writing, and illustrating have always been considered virtuous acts for both Catholic and Buddhist monks, and very early examples of this art exist in both religions.  As I&#8217;ve discovered, although drastically fewer in number, there are still people out there who are laying out vellum, grinding brilliant earth pigment, and creating a masterpiece that can bring themselves or a reader closer to enlightenment or heaven.  I will find these people who are still concerned with the saturation of ink on paper, the feel of the brush, and the ethereal gold dust of illumination in this digital age.  Studying an artistic technique with a true artisan in its respective context is invaluable.  I half experienced this briefly when, last year, I was allotted an easel at the Louvre in Paris and had the opportunity to use the technique of the old masters.  Unfortunately,  Albrecht Dürer was not looking over my shoulder, and I could not ask him if the saturation of my alizarin crimson was okay.  Through this present project, however, I will be able to touch the hands of my teachers, share a brush, and be as close to the ancient world as humanly possible without a time machine.  </p>

<p>	Through my research on manuscripts of both the Christian and Buddhist faiths, I have yet to come across a publication contrasting or comparing the extraordinarily similar illuminated manuscripts (both in purpose and production).  When I examine part of a Himalayan scroll next to a page from a Christian book of hours (for example) the aesthetic similarities seem endless.   Now that I am studying theology more extensively (in one class devoted to the Gospel According to St. Matthew and another on the Buddhist Tradition) the similarities are twofold:  first, I saw aesthetic possibilities to compare and now I see the beginnings of how similar the cultural traditions are as far as symbolism and the purpose of monastic literature.</p>

<p>Thanks to scholars such as St. John of Damascus (In Defense of Icons, c. 730) who were able to write during the Iconoclastic controversies by living under Muslim rule, some early scholarship exists on the subject of Christian iconographical programs.  Buddhists, on the other hand, have almost always venerated books and there are many rich libraries containing all types of xylographs, preserved pages, and covered manuscripts.  Today, at every Sunday mass, millions upon millions of Catholics will stand as the Holy Bible is brought forth, raised above the sanctified procession of clergy preceding Eastward toward the altar (and, not incidentally, the holy land itself).  The holy volume, which has now taken on an iconographical significance, is read to the congregation.  The Book of Kells (which is housed at the Trinity College Library in Dublin, Ireland) contains the four gospels along with six hundred and eighty pages of illumination.  People take pilgrimages to see just one page of this magnificent manuscript.  Alternatively, since the ninth century AD, Buddhist manuscripts have been used as not only a record of the visages of holy deities, but as an aid in meditation.  In fact, in Tantric Buddhism the images often contained on scrolls are used to reveal unconscious ideas that could ultimately lead to individual enlightenment.  Mahayana Sutras encourage the worship of the book itself.  Historically, books have played a significant role in the transmission of Buddhism.  On this subject, Dr. Pratapaditya Pal, in the introduction to his book Buddhist Book Illuminations writes the following:</p>

<p>From about the time of Christ books have not only played a significant role in the religious life of a pious Buddhist, but they have also served as the principal instrument in transmitting the religion from India to most countries of Asia east of Iran.  No Buddhist book, however, enjoys the preeminence the Bible does among Christians, or the Koran among Muslims&#8230;curiously, however, no Tibetan scholar has written an account of the history of the book in Tibet, illustrated or not.  Indeed, the material is so rich that an entire book can be written on the subject, and the review here should be regarded as providing a framework for future studies.<br />
	<br />
	This past summer I was able to meet with Ms. Joanne Schneider who is now the Director of Library and Information Services at St. Michael&#8217;s College in my hometown of Burlington, Vermont.  Ms. Schneider has been very accommodating in helping me form a tentative bibliography and find contacts.  She served as a consultant to the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, Dharamsala, India and the Drepung Loeslin Library Society in Mungdod, India. </p>

<p>	I will break up travel into two Christian European (Greece and Russia) and two Eastern (Tibet and North India) countries containing illuminated manuscripts (this includes a trip to the aforementioned Dharamsala Library and Cultural Center).  Even though my project contains an archival element, my passion lies with the creation of these books themselves.  I want to talk to artisans and monks, hold their pens in my hand, learn about the spiritual fulfillment they receive from copying, and stain my fingers with the gold powder used in illumination.    </p>

<p>My first destination is Greece, because this is the place where lies the root of the Christian Byzantine Iconoclastic controversy.  Miniature painting began here and I will put into context what I have thus far learned on the subject.  During my stay in Greece, I had hoped to visit The Great Lavra Monastery on Athos, which boasts of the greatest collection of manuscripts, as well as the Vatopedi monastery.  Unfortunately, women are not allowed on Mount Athos at all.  I immediately called a Greek friend and was able to find other libraries such as the Meterora in Central Greece and St. Catherine in Sinai.  The website for The Organization for the Cultural Capital of Europe Thessaloniki and the Holy Community of Mount Athos has a comprehensive list of monasteries and their collections.  While recently visiting a Franciscan monastery in Kennebunkport, Maine I was excited to discover reproductions of icons illuminated and made (seemingly) preserving the ancient techniques employed on gospel pages, imported from a Greek atelier.  I have also seen similar examples imported to be sold in the Crypt Library at Chartres Cathedral in Paris, France.  I will find these artisans and monks prior to travel who are involved in the defense of their historical manuscript imagery.  According to the Hellenic Ministry of Culture, forty to fifty percent of the total of remaining Greek manuscripts date from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, so there is still much contemporary production.  <br />
 <br />
	From Greece I will travel to Russia.  This is the perfect place to continue to look at Christian manuscripts while forming an introduction to the Asian texts brought from the Orient by missionaries, scholars, and politicians.  I will fly to St. Petersburg, to visit the National Library of Russia.  Therein lies a massive collection of manuscripts from the Christian east, including the Tbetic Gospel from the year 995.  According to Olga Vasilieva, the Curator of the MS Department Oriental Collection, the National Library of Russia &#8220;&#8230;has also published 5 issues of &#8216;Collected Oriental Materials&#8217; in order to promote awareness of its collections of Oriental manuscripts.  The Library personnel and its users are continuously engaged in research of its collections and individual manuscripts.  The results of this research are then included into the auxiliary collection of the Manuscript Division.&#8221;  I&#8217;m hoping to find a Buddhist and Christian artistic merge here as I move in a sort of historical chronology.  </p>

<p>	 Two other specific places that I will visit are the Tretyakov Gallery and the Russian Museum.  At the latter there exists a manuscript production and restoration project that I will contact and attempt to apprentice with briefly called the Scriptorium di Manoscritti Miniatti with chapters in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Looking for opportunities to apprentice will require some flexibility.  According to their website, the Scriptorium was founded in 1974.  They advertise:</p>

<p><i>&#8230;The scriptorium specialized in the restoration of Icons and illuminated manuscripts for the Old Believers community of Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow.  In 1988 Scriptorium had its first permanent (for the period of one year) exhibition of the Illuminated Manuscripts in the Archbishop&#8217;s Palace in Moscow.  After more than 25 years of artistic activity, manuscripts and miniatures of the Scriptorium can be found in a number of important collections worldwide, including the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch collection, Danilov Monastery and the Victoria and Albert Museum Collection.</i></p>

<p>Leaving Russia, I will travel to the Tibetan Community at Dharamsala, North India.  Here is the place to lay the foundation for understanding Buddhist manuscripts.  Herein lies the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives (or LTWA).  Since the foundation of the library by the 14th Dalai Llama of Tibet, the institution is devoted to the preservation and conservation of Tibetan manuscripts.  It also exists as a foreign-student friendly learning center in which rooms are let for a very modest cost-per-month.  At my fingertips would be more than 80,000 manuscripts, books, and documents (according to their statement of interest on the Tibetnet Website).  In their lengthy statement of purpose, the LTWA list &#8220;acquiring and conserving Tibetan books and manuscripts, providing access to books and manuscripts, and supporting research and study of the Tibetan language and the tradition of arts and crafts&#8221; as priorities.  Because of the people passionately devoted to this art form it will be easy to meet Tibetan copyists who could point me to monastic centers in the Western Himalayas (such as Tsaparang where there exists temple wall paintings and a library). <br />
     <br />
The origins of Tibetan Buddhist art are rooted in portrayals of the Buddha following his death.  Although nothing like the Byzantine iconoclastic controversy, there was indeed some discussion on whether or not human representations were worthy of his memory.  Of course, after the ninth century art was being created and preserved, opening imaginations and bringing forth the possibility of awakening one&#8217;s inner Buddha.  At the end of his forward, Pratapaditya pal writes the following in his aforementioned text Buddhist Book Illumination, <br />
 <br />
<i>The Sutras were often copied not for personal use but for several other purposes.  Both arduously and beautifully written and even illuminated, books were frequently deposited in stupas and images for one reason or another.  The Buddhists firmly believe that such acts not only increase their personal merit but also help preserve the faith for posterity as well as augment the efficacy of the monument or image.</i></p>

<p>After spending some time at the Learning Center as a student, connections will be formed that could provide further access for travel to Tibet itself.  Although I have not found a singular, all-encompassing institution such as the LTWA, I find it imperative to travel to a historical place of origin to fully connect the culture of a people to the art that they are creating.  Speaking with Himalayan monks will perhaps shed light on the usage of book worship and copying. <br />
  <br />
	It is apparent from writers and historians such as Pal that there exists the dire need to continue to study the tradition of ancient book making and illumination.  In my introductory research (though it could not be called a thorough survey) I have not found a single document devoted to linking the two forms of art.  Books contain within their covers an entire world of mystery and enigmatic splendour.  When looking upon their aesthetic and scriptural wealth, however, it is less ambiguous to understand why they have been worshipped and copied.  Through talking to artists, trying my hand at techniques, and spending some time with Russian, Greek, and Tibetan scholars, I will find out why the tradition has endured and perhaps illuminate a mystery or two.</p>
