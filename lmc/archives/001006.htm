You've probably heard many yarns begin this way, but I'll spin another one in hopes of spinning a different way.</p>

<p>The phrase homeless is a politically and socially loaded term. When I say homeless, the predominant imagery a reader has is that of the society's fractured, on the streets with cups in hand, or wrapped up in blankets on the night's sidewalks. These are, without debate, the least fortunate of the urban world's residents. And the debate about how best to help them is a complex one, for which we as individuals might do what we can to alleviate their sufferings. Once, for instance, on an 8 hour layover at Greyhound Chicago, I brought a homeless man with me to a McDonald's for lunch, a rewarding experience that I recommend trying.</p>

<p>But this is not the reason I bring up the term homeless. Because being homeless is not just a physical reality. It is often a psychological one. It is easy enough to declare: "I have a house, therefore I am not homeless". But the physically homeless man sees concrete in a different way than us, and just as appropriately, we should not face the word "homeless" with concreteness. Often, when I am throwing all of my things into the backpack for the umpteenth time I wonder if I am technically homeless, or perhaps the opposite:  am I less homeless now than at any point in my life?</p>

<p>When traveling, you'll easily meet people from all over the world. One of the first questions asked is: "Where are you from." (De donde es?) I consider this something of a difficult question. Usually I say New York, because it is a widely known location. But I've lived nearby Seattle for the last five years. Isn't this my home? In comparison, my situation is simple. Take Jose, who was born in Chile, but had to flee the country for politcal asylum in England when he was five. Now he has returned for a vacation in Chile, to realize that his English accent is strong, and isn't accepted as a Chilean. Or Rachel, who grew up in South Africa and now for financial reasons has moved to London. Her home is somewhere in between. Phil made the move in the opposite direction: England to New Zealand, and to those of either country his accent is noticeably from some other island. In a sense, the readily accessible opportunity of travel is an intoxication whose only side effect is dislocation. When we stop, we can probably find a home, but will it be a home?</p>

<p>This leads me to an experience last night in Mendoza, Argentina. Walking around for dinner, I spotted a vegetarian restaurant. Now, I'm not a vegetarian, but after two months of indirectly slaughering the pigs, cows, and chickens of Argentina and Chile, only the most voracious of meat eaters wouldn't be curious at seeing a restaurant named "The Green Apple". I took the chance and decided to eat there. It was a slow night and so the owner came to chat with me. Before long, I realized I had met yet another person with the kernel of homelessness.</p>

<p>Christina was born, raised, and married at 15 in Mendoza. Then, on her husband's wishes, she went to New York City to learn English to aid the business they were running back in Argentina. Before long, she realized she had many more opportunities in NYC than at home, and got a divorce. She would stay in the States for 33 years, loving every minute of it, only to return because she promised her mother that she would come back if she was needed.</p>

<p>This is where she is now, running her vegetarian restaurant. And I do mean running. During our conversation she was yet another friendly and welcoming Argentine. With that lovable and recognizable mixture of haste, impatience, with a strange variety of love, she would raise from the chair to remind her young severs of their duties, and with a half-smile, half-scowl they would carry them out. She was the first person I had met that was truly Argentine and New Yorker. Her accent strayed somewhere in between, and her foul-language, strong opinions, and dirty jokes left no doubt on the matter. You haven't lived  until you've heard an Argentine say "pecker."</p>

<p>But as the restaurant approached its midnight closing time, she confessed that she was close to crying. Meeting me had reminded her of so much that she missed about New York City. In fact, talking to her reminded me that even I miss some things from my home state. At this, I didn't know what to say. Do I say "thank you" or "I'm sorry"? Or do I summon the New Yorker in me and say "It's not that baaad"? I think she saw all of the choices I was considering, and the pause was enough. I finished my brilliant pear cheesecake, and left satisfactorily, with that comforting feeling of a having lived a day that has reached its true conclusion.</p>

<p>At the end of it all, I think I can depend on the fact that no matter where I'm headed next, it is one step closer to home. But I realize this is an assumption. Perhaps home is wherever you stop. In the meantime, raise some potential energy.</p>

<p>Always moving, ever onward, the Watson soul.</p><a name="more"></a><div class="blog"><div id="menu"><a href="../archives/001004.htm">&laquo; Its Me, Carlos the Mendozan Geologist</a> || <a href="../archives/001007.htm">A Quick Blip From B.A. &raquo;</a><br /></div></div></div></div><div class="journal_entriesbottom"></div><div id="comments"><div class="comments-head"><a name="comments"></a>Comments</div><div class="comments-body"><p>i've always contemplated that one. home. what is it. where is it. i had always come to the conclusion that home is not a place but a state of being, a way of feeling accepted and accepting yourself enough to know that no matter where you are you're home.<br />
i find it interesting that in discussing the subject of homes you include so much detail as to the accent of the person. it seems so important to people, accents. i am a foreigner in washington merely because i don't sound like one and same in new mexico. in both people think i sound like i'm from canada, and yet i've never really been to canada!</p><div class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;creaser&#64;ups&#46;edu">charysse</a> on October 17, 2003 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="comments-body"><p>Home is a pretty strange topic, I'd agree.  I lived in the Dee-pot for 18 years, but haven't been there for more than a week at a time in the past 4 years, so is that my home?  I was at school in Ithaca for 4 years, but don't feel at all like that was my home.  I spent a semester in Southern France, and psychologically felt very much at home there.  I spent a year at school in Rochester but certainly wouldn't call that God-forsaken place my home.  And now I've been here in Central Pennsylvania for about the past 5 months, and have a job and apartment, but I don't really feel like this is my home, either.  I still feel like an outsider here.  Whenever my patients ask me where I'm from (I'm a physical therapist, for those who don't know me), I tell them about New York, and I always catch myself saying "I live about 5 miles from Quebec and about 30 miles from Vermont," using the present tense.  I'm not sure how to analyze that, not sure what it means.  I think it's strange, though, that I feel a much stronger attachment to little ol' Ellenburg Depot and the North Country now that I've moved away.  Meeting people who've grown up in different places, both geographical and societal, I realize how the North Country has helped to shape me, and I appreciate it much more than I ever did while living there.  <br />
I feel that my motto has become a quote by Thomas Paine:  "Independence is my happiness, and I view things as they are, without regard to place or person; my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."</p><div class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;adamshutts&#64;yahoo&#46;com">Adam</a> on October 17, 2003 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="comments-body"><p>Wow, that turned out to be really long.

Most times I try not to give people a geography test, however, and just leave it up to their assumption that I´m from NYC.</p>

<p>Charysse, accent is a strange unwieldy beast isn´t it... here every now and then if I meet an Englishman my English changes to include lots of ¨carry on´s¨ and ¨quid¨ and ¨be right¨ ... and also the lady at the restaurant said that sometimes people recognize her nyísh accent and accuse her in a negative fashion of being a yankee... she obviously stands out compared to others... and sometimes its not for the better.</p>

<p>i like the thomas paine mantra... it seems to work surprisingly well as advice from the 18th century to the 21st... i suppose this is an age-old question...</p><div class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;bdefore&#64;ups&#46;edu">Buck</a> on October 18, 2003 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="comments-body"><p>Born and raised in London, with a strong English accent, I tend to confuse the hell out of people on where Im from, mainly due to my dark complexion! But I have know discovered home is where ever YOU want me to be from! (Remember Buck, Colombia, Brazil, France and god knows where else I was supposed to be from!) </p>

<p>For me home is where heart is and heavily on the state of mind I am in.  When I was in Buenos Aries, which felt like home, even though it was a short period of time, the friends I made, made it feel like home. We were a little family, happy, and that was home as long as I was there!<br />
